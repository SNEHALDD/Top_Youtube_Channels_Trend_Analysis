Python is the best language to learn when you are beginning with software development

There are loads of Python resources online to choose from, but this is the only course that takes you from a complete beginner in software development, teaches you the fundamentals, advanced topics, and makes you an expert in this field.

In addition, you have loads of practice exercises and challenges to work on. I didn't just add a bunch of exercises at the end. Instead, each concept is put in code and practiced so that we make sure you apply and learn everything through action.

You get over 24 hours of on-demand videos, exercises and most importantly projects to apply the knowledge we talk about.

I've spent years building software in Python, and years again teaching people how to build code for themselves.

This is the most complete course I've ever done, and it's all to help you on your journey to become an expert developer.

We will cover basic topics such as

language fundamentals

collections

flow control

loops

handling errors and exceptions

functions

higher order functions

recursion

generators

modules

working with files

As well as advanced topics such as

Object Oriented Programming

Principles of development

Properties

Decorators

Libraries such as

requests for network communications

sqlite3 for SQL

tkinter for GUI applications

BeautifulSoup for HTML scraping

And we will be working on projects such as

hangman

tic tac toe

GUI clicker

store manager

weather app

web scraping

You only need to take ONE COURSE to master Python, it's this one.

Todays video is long overdue you have all been asking me to do a room tour throughout the year and the video is finally here ! I'll be doing a room tour of the room I stayed in 2021 during my first Aupair year ! remember that every family is different and all families decorate their homes and Aupair rooms differently the best thing to do to make your room feel homey is to decorate it and also put up pictures of your family and friends that helps a lot!

Sorry I haven't been active in a few days, but in today's video, I am starting my mixed media abstract journal, and I'm very excited about the upcoming videos I have planned, and I hope you all enjoy them 😊. I've been loving mixed media journaling because it's very freeing and there's a lot of exploring with different colors that I've been loving so much. I would also like to share that you need to buy a whole bunch of stationery to create a beautiful spread. This might look messy to others, but it's so beautiful to me, and that's what it's about.

This vlog was a bit short, but I just wanted to wake up at 6 am in order to be more productive, and I feel like I was able to get a lot done these last few days. I was able to get a lot of filming done, editing, and digital prints for my shop. And even after I finished filming this, I continued waking up at 6 am, and I'm going to continue doing that. I know this was a short vlog, and that's because I filmed content for like 2 days, and only got a certain amount, but I hope you still enjoyed seeing what I do in a day!

In today's video, I am showing you how you can make this super cute vintage sticker book. It's not really stickers because I didn't use sticker paper, but you can use that if you actually want to make it a sticker book. I just used book pages for this project and used glue at the end. And if you want to make it like stickers, but still use the book pages, just add double-sided tape to the back of the pages.

- “Skull” deals with the blameless role of soldiers in wars, in general. Their obligation to become assassins and deserve the damnation of their souls. Facing death powerless and hopeless. Waiting for peace, after having paid for their guiltless sins.
These two songs are dramatically actual these days.
- “At Your Whim” is a love song, in its own way. A perfect love destroyed by its own perfection. People don’t always understand the blessing of sharing their lives with brilliant, talented partners. They need to stand out and prevail, even though they don’t have any talent. Just a complex of inferiority that leads to a definitive break. “Poor little man” (or woman).
- “D.I.D.” is based on a minor character in an almost famous Story/Movie/Serie, that I won’t mention. It’s the story of a cruelly abused woman soldier who developed a dissociative identity disorder, to survive and take back control of her life, and more than this, to be a winner. She became a professional killer, but sometimes “her other self” comes out trying to interfere with the killings and save her soul.
- “Reign of Mediocrity” is the manifesto of wasted talents, of brilliant, fucking genial artists, of their frustration and their need to abandon the ruling mediocrity, to feel alive. They don’t belong down here in this reign of white collars.
- “Children of Nonsense” poses the problem of the adaptation strategy of young people to a world of nonsense. A world of empty, meaningless prosperity.
- “Timeless Spaces”, in contrast with “Reign of Mediocrity” is about accepting compromises and, more than this, embracing the dirty path of fulfilling ambitions. The dangerous attempt to run after some giants of an obscure, criminal world.
- “Beauty Insane” is the natural evolution of DID: mental insanity that finds its way out. Out of pharmacological control, out of cells, back into the world. I was thinking about how easily women in the 19th/20th century used to be locked in asylums, just at the will of bored husbands.
- “Home” depicts the “abused souls” scenario of  the album. It deals with domestic violence, all sorts of it. Physical or verbal, violence disfigures the mind of a growing child as well as that of an adult, letting them believe that pain is part of life, something to accept because of love. I mentioned Jobe from the Bible and his love for a God who challenges him with any kind of disease and pain.
Nevertheless, each song ends well! My characters are all winners, in their own way, or I let them find peace, in the end. Maybe in a killing, but I don’t mind judging a distorted mind and its own choices, I don’t even know who actually can be defined as distorted. Maybe I could...

25 anni fa, il 17 luglio 1997, i THE MAGIK WAY prepararono la colonna sonora dello spettacolo teatrale ""Dracula"" diretto da Hermes Beltrame (Teatro degli Specchi) al Castello di Pomaro in provincia di Alessandria. Oggi a distanza di un quarto di secolo siamo riusciti a restaurare quel pezzo di storia e di farlo uscire dalle tenebre in cui era rimasto per tutto questo tempo.
Che l'Occulto Rituale abbia inizio.

English lyrics

- SKIN -

The sun injures the eyes. The heat drains the tongue.
Red eyes full of emptiness. The emptiness around burning.
Dry skin, arid, falling to the ground like snow.
The extortion of thirst moves around the pathetic scene of normality.
Dragging cement feet on cement ground in the reflection of a cement mirror,
look what are you now.
Chasing your reflection in a labyrinth of lost gazes,
in the hole of a crowd, eager for time, drowning in the asphalt quicksand,
convince yourself to live.

“I walk the path of your body, I cross it, it overwhelms me.
I don’t know you, I find you again. Your sharpened skin caresses me.
I hold my breath, tears fall, I spit my sorrow, quills are born.”
“This embrace wards us off,
it’s a desertion that embraces us,
it’s a dusk that envelops us.
A poison has chosen me, I devour pain.”
“I hold you as if I have to say goodbye to my loneliness.
Needles insinuate in the deepest and most hidden spaces of my skin.
Our wounded bodies move in an ancient dawn.
It the closest sensation to heat I can feel.
Now cold is all I can feel.”

“There’s no light anymore, only darkness, relentless, impalpable darkness…
I feel quills down in my throat, they pierce me till my eyes, and all is black… 
And, whether I try not to drain in my blood,
the vortex of your gaze, where I could (would) die,
drags me down in the deep abyss of your eyes.
And if sorrow didn’t push me away I would continue to stab us
Until there’s no flesh left to sustain us,
until only gangrene will infect what’s left of us.”
In the last minute of life, remembering only now your mortality, 
Craving your dreams as if they were become unattainable,
your heart passes away, eaten by who you couldn’t help but love.

THE TRUE EVIL (lyrics)

faiths are the true evil
everyone who claims
to manage your behavior your
your actions are the true evil
the true evil is to follow
the precepts of others
the power is the evil itself
those who claim
to legislate to compel to oversee
are true evil
the true evil is to follow
the precepts of others

NEL TEMPO (lyrics)

provo a pensare alla vita che ho vissuto
ogni istante che ho amato ogni giorno che ho sprecato
tutto l'odio è forse come allora forse peggio
verso cose che stan fuori da ogni razionalità

provo a ripensare a quello che potevo fare
quello che potevo dire a come agire meglio
mi vedo ogni sera ogni sera riprovare emozioni
sempre nuove sentimenti sempre vivi

ogni nota è come se l'avessi fatta ieri
come se il nostro viaggio non dovesse mai arrestarsi
perché non è giusto che la fantasia e i sogni
si abbandonino col tempo ci abbandonino nel tempo

AMANDOTI

Amarti m'affatica
Mi svuota dentro
“eri dolce e candida”
Qualcosa che assomiglia
A ridere nel pianto
“il calore mai provato”
Amarti m'affatica
Mi dà malinconia
“la libertà infinita che mi donavi”
Che vuoi farci, è la vita
È la vita la mia
“Si è presto rivelata un'indicibile schiavitù”
Amami ancora
Fallo dolcemente
“non sono più un uomo, ma un burattino”
Un anno, un mese, un'ora
Perdutamente
“se solo avessi il coraggio sceglierei la morte”
Amarti mi consola
Le notti bianche
“mi hai regalato una realtà diversa”
Qualcosa che riempie
Vecchie storie fumanti
“Ma mi hai rubato la volontà”
Amarti mi consola
Mi dà allegria
“la mia vita non è degna”
Che vuoi farci, è la vita
È la vita la mia
“sangue impuro scorre in me”
Amami ancora
Fallo dolcemente
“Non riesco a smettere di amarti”
Un anno, un mese, un'ora
Perdutamente
“anche se so che mi ucciderai”
Amami ancora
Fallo dolcemente
“prego la nera signora, possa liberarmi”
Solo per un'ora
Perdutamente
“rendermi libero finalmente da te”

Frederick Frostwick is currently completing his undergraduate studies in Classics at the University of St Andrews, where he is a Campbell Watterson Organ Scholar and studies organ with Tom Wilkinson and Claire Innes-Hopkins.  As organ scholar he accompanies St Salvator’s Chapel Choir in their weekly services as well as for concerts and special services.  In November 2021 Freddie accompanied St Salvator’s Chapel Choir in their live broadcast of Sunday morning worship on BBC Radio 4 for Advent Sunday.  
  

Freddie began his musical career as a cathedral chorister, first at Truro Cathedral for a year, and subsequently at Westminster Abbey between 2010 and 2014. With Westminster Abbey, he sang at nationally televised state occasions, and took part in several recordings.  He also toured to Rome, where the Choir sang at the invitation of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and Hungary.
  
In 2014 Freddie joined Bryanston School as a music scholar and began organ studies under Graham Scott, alongside studies in piano, violin, viola and singing.  In addition, he has received tuition from internationally acclaimed organists including Nathan Laube, Christian Wilson, Henry Fairs, Margaret Phillips and Ann-Elise Smoot.  
  
Freddie was appointed organ scholar at St Paul’s Within the Walls Episcopal Church, Rome for the academic year beginning September 2019. Whilst in Rome Freddie gained experience playing for the various liturgies of the church, helping compile the music lists and directing the choir.    
  
As well as an accompanist, Freddie has experience as a soloist, having performed at St Paul’s Church, Knightsbridge, Christchurch Priory, and venues across Hong-Kong in 2019 as part of a horn trio (piano).    


In dir ist Freude
In Thee is gladness
Amid all sadness,
Jesus, sunshine of my heart.
By Thee are given
The gifts of heaven,
Thou the true Redeemer art.
Our souls Thou wakest,
Our bonds Thou breakest;
Who trusts Thee surely
Has built securely;
He stands forever: Alleluia!
Our hearts are pining
To see Thy shining,
Dying or living
To Thee are cleaving;
Naught can us sever: Alleluia!

 Schmücke dich o liebe Seele
Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,
Leave the gloomy haunts of sadness;
Come into the daylight’s splendour,
There with joy thy praises render
Unto Christ whose grace unbounded
Hath this wondrous banquet founded.
Higher o’er all the heav’ns He reigneth,
Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth.

O Traurigkeit, O Herzeleid
O darkest woe!
Ye tears forth flow!
Has earth so sad a wonder,
That the Father's only Son
Now lies buried yonder!

The organ in St Salvator’s Chapel was built in 1973 by the Austrian firm of Gregor Hradetzky. It was designed in consultation with the noted British recitalist and broadcaster Geraint Jones and reflects the ethos of the Modernist movement in its use of materials, its physical and tonal structure, voicing techniques and winding system. The organ replaced a twice-rebuilt Henry Willis II organ of 1904.

Ziying He began playing the piano at the age of three, and achieved her first diploma (ATCL) on piano at the age of 11. She is currently a student at University of St Andrews, majoring in Economics. During her journey with the piano, she has participated in many music festivals and competitions, and been awarded several prices. In 2017, Ziying performed in a concert in London, which raised money to purchase a piano for the patients at St Bartholomew’s Hospital. In addition to her solo performances, she was also a member of the CBSO Youth Orchestra in 2018. She gave two performances of the Grieg Piano Concerto with the Solihull Symphony Orchestra in 2020, and with Birmingham Sinfonia Orchestra conducted by Michael Seal in 2022.

Morgan Jones' relationship with the piano stems back to when he was very young. He was exposed to many musical opportunities in his hometown of Bath, from playing movements from concertos accompanied by a professional orchestra to writing and arranging music for small chamber groups. Having been a piano scholar since 2021, Morgan has studied under Ancuta Nite at St Andrews, and was a winner of the 2022 Music Centre Soloist Competition. Additionally, learning the piano has recently opened doors into genres other than classical music, such as jazz, which has enriched and rounded his musical career.",

St Salvator’ s Chapel Choir is the flagship choir of the University of St Andrews, Scotland. A mixed voice ensemble of around 30 students, its history extends back to the founding of the University in the early fifteenth century , when students were obliged to sing in the University’s chapel. These choristers were referred to as the ‘Choristi Sanctiandree’. 

Today, under the direction of Claire Innes-Hopkins, the choir performs a broad repertoire spanning the six centuries of the University’s history. In addition to three sung services per week and extensive ceremonial duties, the choir enjoys a busy schedule of concerts, international tours and broadcasts on radio and TV, as well as appearances at international festivals including, most recently, the Thüringer Bachwochen (Germany), Haarlem Koorbiennale and Orgelfestival Holland (The Netherlands). Other recent tours have featured performances at Washington National Cathedral and Princeton University (USA) and with renowned baritone Peter Harvey in Sweden. In 2019 the choir toured throughout France including concerts in Burgundy, Marseille, and the Cathedral of Aix-en-Provence, and performed the opening concert of the International Organ Festival in Alkmaar, the Netherlands, subsequently broadcast on Dutch radio. 

Recordings on the University’s own internationally distributed CD label have included Salvator Mundi charting 100 years of English church music after Purcell, Bach and the Stile Antico, charting the evolution of the Credo from Bach’s Mass in B minor via works known to, and performed by, Bach during its composition and Annunciations featuring music by James MacMillan and six new works commissioned for the choir as part of the University’s TheoArtistry project. Most recently, the choir has released the first recording made under studio conditions of Sigismund von Neukomm’s Requiem in C minor, written for the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This recording was a collaboration with the Wallace Collection who perform on historic brass instruments. The choir’s new CD for Christmas, ‘The Tyger and the Lamb’ will be released later this month. 
Committed to the performance of new music, St Salvator’s Chapel Choir regularly commissions and performs works for both liturgical and secular contexts and during 2019 were Choir and Organ magazine’s Commissioning Partners. In recent years the choir has been privileged to work with musicians such as Sir James MacMillan, Robert Hollingworth, Paul Mealor and Dame Emma Kirkby.

In 2019 Claire was musical director for Byre Opera, the University’s professionally run opera company, which received a four-star review in The Times for the performance of two one-act operas, Vaughan Williams Riders to the Sea and Madeleine Dring Cupboard Love. 

Claire read Music at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where she studied the organ with Thomas Trotter, and has worked previously at Winchester College, Magdalen College, Oxford, Peterborough Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral. Prior to moving to Scotland, Claire was Assistant Director of Music at Rochester Cathedral, where she directed the girl choristers, and in her final year there 2017-2018 was Acting Director of Music, directing the boy choristers in addition to the girls, and running the busy music department. Claire gives regular organ recitals around the UK, and notable performances include Saint-Saëns Organ Symphony at the Royal Albert Hall, and Giles Swayne’s The Stations of the Cross at Lincoln Cathedral, in the presence of the composer. Claire began her musical life as a chorister at St Albans Cathedral, where she caught the sacred music bug, and has been fully immersed in music ever since.


The organ in St Salvator’s Chapel was built in 1973 by the Austrian firm of Gregor Hradetzky. It was designed in consultation with the noted British recitalist and broadcaster Geraint Jones and reflects the ethos of the Modernist movement in its use of materials, its physical and tonal structure, voicing techniques and winding system. The organ replaced a twice-rebuilt Henry Willis II organ of 1904.

Jan Stransky was born in Podebrady, Czech Republic and began his guitar studies at the age of seven with Zdenek Bastinec, a Professor at the Prague Conservatory.  On leaving school, he went on to study guitar at the Prague Conservatory with Professor Patrick Vacik where he was one of eight students selected to perform in a graduation concert with orchestra. In 2018, he was admitted to the Music Academy in Weimar, Germany as a pupil of Thomas Muller-Pering and he is presently studying at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland as a pupil of Allan Neave and Matthew McAllister. Recent projects have included a collaboration with San Francisco-based composer Lukas Janata on his guitar composition Lamentations.


Jacques Carroll-Leitao is a guitarist, composer and lutenist hailing from Glasgow. He started learning music at the age of 6, and aimed for a musical career early on, attending Douglas Academy followed by the RCS, from which he has recently graduated. Jacques specialises in classical guitar but has a wide range of musical interests and knowledge, being an experienced jazz musician and arranger. This has led to him playing in many groups and bands in several different genres. Although classical music remains his primary focus, these other influences are distinctly felt in his many compositions and arrangements. Currently Jacques is pursuing a Masters degree at the RCS and hopes to undertake a PhD on the subject of historical improvisation. At Christmas time, he enjoys playing in the bands for local pantomimes.",

Clackmannan District Brass Band
Clackmannan District Brass Band was formed in October 1991 as a result of the amalgamation of the Alloa Burgh and Alva Town bands – last year marked our 30th anniversary!  
Throughout the year the band organises and performs in regular concerts as well as some smaller group engagements, events and occasions. It has adopted Strathcarron Hospice as their ""sponsored"" charity – having the honour of meeting Princess Anne as well as accompany the Strathcarron Singers on many occasion.  
 
The band has had a great deal of contesting success over the years, representing Scotland at the National Championships on no fewer than 3 occasions, also winning the accolade to be named ‘Band of the Year’ on three occasions; 2002, 2008 & 2012. Our most recent ‘big’ win was at the Scottish Challenge Shield in November 2017. Where we were not only named best 1st section band, but won the overall contest; beating 23 other bands from across Scotland.
As an organisation we have grown in the past few years. We now consist of the main ’senior’ contesting band, our community Ensemble group (conducted by our Solo Trombone player John Muir), our Youth & Development section and our newly formed Beginners Band (both under the musical direction of our Solo Euphonium player Luci Lamb).
During our enforced break due to COVID the band had to relocate to a new, better suited premises at the Makers Village, Alloa - this move has enabled the bands to get back playing much sooner than our old hall was ever going to permit. It also lends itself to nurture the progression of our new beginners and youth & development sections - giving more space for our members to socialise as well as enabling family members to attend rehearsals to see and hear how well their child/ children are progressing.

Beginner Band
Our beginner band was formed in 2021 - players had been recruited through the StAMP project. With all joining full of enthusiasm to be part of a band.
The organisation’s Christmas concert in 2021 was the first public performance for our beginners - they did a superb job, playing together beautifully in 4 or 5 parts with no nerves in sight!
The band is continuing to grow - with the addition of 6 new beginners from the StAMP project in March this year. The band is becoming so popular, that siblings are also signing up to learn- following in their footsteps.
Thanks to the formation of the beginner band, we now have opportunities for all brass musicians, regardless of age or ability, to pick up an instrument and join the Clackmannan District Brass organisation. The opportunity for development and progression is there for everyone. With a number of players participating in more than one of our bands.
We would like to add what a privilege it is to have been included within the StAMP project – it has enabled us to create an additional feeder band, as well as help to secure the future of brass banding in Clackmannanshire.

Youth and Development Band
Forming in 2016 with just a handful of young musicians, the band has grown in strength and number- comprising of a wide range of ages and abilities. Alongside our school age members, the band includes adult learners and more experienced players to share their knowledge and skills. The senior bands younger back row players sit within the more challenging solo cornet & flugel sections to help improve their playing skills whilst enhancing their confidence.
The band kept in touch virtually throughout the COVID lockdown. A particular highlight was the video advent calen…",

Benedict Holland studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Manoug Parikian and was subsequently a prizewinner at the Royal Northern College of Music, where he studied with Yossi Zivoni.

He was a founder member of the Matisse Piano Quartet and the Music Group of Manchester, broadcasting regularly for the BBC, recording, and undertaking British Council tours and is a member of the Victoria String Quartet whose acclaimed début concert took place in 2017. Also an experienced orchestral leader, he has guest-led many of the UK’s major orchestras, including the Hallé, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Northern Sinfonia, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Scottish Ensemble, Orchestra of Opera North and BBC Philharmonic.

Ben has always championed contemporary music, working with composers Harrison Birtwistle, John Casken, Brett Dean, Oliver Knussen, Steven Mackey, Anna Meredith, Mark Simpson and Duncan Ward, and has been Psappha’s violinist since 2010. 

Personal highlights with Psappha include collaborations with Peter Maxwell Davies, taking Klas Torstensson’s Violin Concerto to a residency at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, premiering Mark Simpson’s chamber opera Pleasure, a tour to Israel of Maxwell Davies’ Eight Songs for a Mad King and a recent broadcast for the BBC of Charlotte Bray’s evocative concerto Caught in Treetops.

Ben has been the leader of chamber orchestra Sinfonia ViVa since 2001 and the orchestra’s Artistic Advisor since 2006, appearing as both director and soloist. Recent solo appearances include works by Beethoven and Mendelssohn, and a performance of Mozart’s A major concerto, broadcast on Classic FM.

Ben teaches at the RNCM, where he was awarded a professorship in 2016, Junior RNCM, and Chetham’s School of Music. He gives consultative classes in orchestral and contemporary techniques at Birmingham and Trinity Laban Conservatoires and professional development classes for string teachers throughout the UK.  He plays on a rare violin by Rogeri of 1710.

Simon Leach graduated from the Royal Northern College of Music in 1992 with the Alice Shawcross Organ Award. Whilst there, he appeared in master classes with Daniel Roth, Olivier Latry, Susan Landale and Jacques Van Ootmerssen. A RNCM travel bursary enabled Simon to travel to Paris to receive some coaching from world renowned organist and composer Naji Hakim. On his return to England he won 1st prize in the Prix Scabo keyboard competition with a performance of Hakim’s Embrace of Fire and was subsequently invited to perform the composers Hommage Á Igor Stravinski in the prestigious Principal’s concert.

After graduating Simon was appointed organ scholar at the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King where he accompanied the choir for services, concerts and on several European tours. Since leaving the Cathedral Simon has combined his work as a freelance performer with a busy private and school teaching schedule.

Anne Page is known in the UK and abroad as a musician who combines virtuosity and versatility. Born and educated in Perth, Australia, the music of Bach first awakened an interest in the organ. Her teacher at the University of Western Australia, Annette Goerke inspired her to study French organ music from the 18th century to Messiaen, and to travel to Europe for lessons with Marie-Claire Alain. Anne subsequently studied with Peter Hurford for whom she deputised in a teaching role at the Royal Academy of Music. Her London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1988 playing 20th century masterpieces marked a commitment to contemporary music which led to commissions and premieres of new works. 


Lessons with Jacques van Oortmerssen on historic instruments, their repertoire and playing techniques were to inform both her playing and teaching.

As a member of the British Institute of Organ Studies she has been closely involved with the Historic Organ Sound Archive, playing an essential role in its organisation as well as researching and performing over 10 hours of recordings for the project. The HOSA project has been a pioneer of free internet access to classical music (see below for details). She continues to give talks to organists' associations about this innovative resource for the study of English organs and their music and has contributed articles on its use to several organ journals.

She has been at the forefront of the revival of interest in the harmonium, an instrument only recently receiving attention from scholars, composers and musicians as a serious medium for historical performance as well as for contemporary music. Swiss organist and composer Lionel Rogg has dedicated a suite of pieces for harmonium to her. She is acknowledged as one of the country's leading experts and has appeared as soloist at the Edinburgh, Three Choirs and Oundle Festivals.

In 2002 the Royal Academy of Music invited her to establish a course in Harmonium, the first in modern times at any conservatory in the UK. She therefore succeeds Lemmens as Professor of Harmonium, who was appointed at the RAM in 1869. In 2008 she gave a full-length harmonium recital in the Purcell Room, the first time the instrument has been featured in a solo role on the South Bank. During eight years (1987-1994) as Artistic and Executive Director of the Cambridge Summer Recitals she programmed many first performances of new works and invited several distinguished recitalists from abroad to give UK debut recitals. Gaston Litaize, Louis Thiry and Olivier Latry gave masterclasses in addition to their concerts. Anne has more recently been instrumental in founding the Cambridge Academy of Organ Studies which presents regular study days with distinguished scholars and teachers and an annual summer course in Cambridge. She teaches a wide range of students including organ scholars at the University of Cambridge and gives classes on the RCO Easter course and the Oundle summer school.",

Although her academic research has centred around music of the high baroque, she enjoys performing music from the mediaeval to the modern and has formed the ensembles Musica Mundana with Eric Thomas (lute & theorbo) and Atelier 32:44 with Ward Ginneberge (accordion). She is regularly invited to perform with Ensemble Ad Libitum in Luxembourg and is also a member of the Spinacino Consort, an ensemble focusing on music from around 1500 featuring voice, recorder, viol and lute. Annemarie is in demand as a tutor on recorder courses across the UK.

David Gerrard performs on the harpsichord, clavichord, fortepiano and organ. In demand as a continuo player, David has performed at home and abroad with both modern and period instrument groups including Dunedin Consort, The English Concert, Irish Baroque Orchestra, Irish Chamber Orchestra, London Mozart Players, Opera Settecento, Royal Northern Sinfonia, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra and The Sixteen. A skilled choir trainer and conductor, he has held appointments as Organ Scholar at Canterbury Cathedral and Magdalen College, Oxford, and as Assistant Organist at Paisley Abbey. David graduated with double first-class honours in Music from the University of Oxford, followed by a master's degree in Early Keyboard Performance from the University of Edinburgh where he is undertaking doctoral research (generously funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council). With experience working as a harpsichord technician and restorer, he has begun building early keyboard instruments.",

John Wallace's new mini-opera is based on Elisabeth Ingram-Wallace’s Opsnizing Dad, which won the Kaleidoscope Health and Care Award for flash fiction in 2017. It deals with how an individual, and society in general, may deal with the primal issue of dementia and social care of a parent in 2100. Wallace, recently announced as recipient of the Queen’s Medal for Music,  writes ‘I have tried to heighten the tragedy of dementia through the unbearable optimism of the son in trying to keep life going through it all - his eruptions into banal obscenities through his frustrations with his father leading to anger and complete loss of personal control. During the action, past, present and future blur together in one rapid continuum, but through it all, the love of a son for his father shines through.’

Renowned Scottish tenor Jamie MacDougall is joined by members of the Wallace Collection, by Music Centre vocal scholars, and by associate teachers.

Morgan Jones (Music Centre piano scholar)

Isla Cartney is in her final year studying an MA in History, but seems to spend nearly as much time on her musical pursuits as she does her studies.

Isla has been playing clarinet since she was 11 and currently studies under Alexander South at the University. She is also taught by Ian Wilson at the North East of Scotland Music School, where she currently holds a scholarship. Isla plays in many of the University ensembles and is currently manager of the Music Society Symphony Orchestra and a member of the Scholarship Saxophone Quartet.


Morgan Jones’ relationship with the piano stems back to when he was very young. He was exposed to many musical opportunities in his hometown of Bath, from playing movements from concertos accompanied by a professional orchestra to writing and arranging music for small chamber groups. Additionally, learning the piano has recently opened doors into genres other than classical music, such as jazz, which has enriched and rounded his musical career. 

Simon Smith was born in Northumberland in 1983. At St Mary's Music School in Edinburgh he studied piano with Richard Beauchamp and composition with Tom David Wilson. In Cambridge he studied composition with Jeremy Thurlow and Giles Swayne.

As a pianist he has performed many of the landmarks of the 20th-century repertoire, most notably the piano concerto and complete Etudes of György Ligeti, following a performance of which he was described as “a phenomenon – nothing daunts him, technically or musically” (The Scotsman). For Delphian Records he has recorded solo music by James MacMillan, Stuart MacRae, Hafliði Hallgrímsson and Thomas Wilson. A two-disc set of the complete piano music of Alfred Schnittke, released in 2013, was acclaimed as “compelling and utterly persuasive” (BBC Music Magazine) and praised for its “extraordinary sensitivity, detail and emotional commitment” (The Independent). A disc of piano music by Valentin Silvestrov was released in 2015. As a member of Red Note Ensemble he has recorded works by John McLeod, Eddie McGuire, David Wilde and James Dillon.

A specialist in music notation, Simon also works professionally as an editor and music engraver, having produced scores for Boosey & Hawkes of numerous large-scale works by Harrison Birtwistle, James MacMillan and others. In recent years he has concentrated increasingly on the music of Stockhausen. For the Stockhausen-Verlag he has produced new editions of Mantra for two pianos and the ten-player Soloists' Version of Michaels Reise. He was invited to take part as synthesizer player in the first performances of this version of Michaels Reise in 25 years at the 2015 Stockhausen Courses Kürten, where he was also awarded first prize for his interpretation of Klavierstück XII. At the 2019 Courses he received the first prize for a performance of Klavierstück XIII (Luzifers Traum). He has given performances of many of the Klavierstücke in the UK, Germany and the USA.",

The organ in St Salvator’s Chapel was built in 1973 by the Austrian firm of Gregor Hradetzky. It was designed in consultation with the noted British recitalist and broadcaster Geraint Jones and reflects the ethos of the Modernist movement in its use of materials, its physical and tonal structure, voicing techniques and winding system. The organ replaced a twice-rebuilt Henry Willis II organ of 1904.

Chris Bragg was born in Stirling and is a former Organ Scholar of Dunblane Cathedral. He studied organ performance at the former RSAMD and at the Amsterdam Conservatory. His teachers included Michael Harris, Pieter van Dijk and Pier Damiano Peretti. In addition, he studied church music at the Utrecht Conservatory and clavichord with Menno van Delft. He has performed solo recitals in six European countries and in the USA. 

Chris Bragg is Head of Programming at the University of St Andrews Music Centre where he led the re-housing of the historic 1868 T.C. Lewis organ in the McPherson Recital Room. He is also Artistic Director of St Andrews Organ Week, organist of St Salvador’s Episcopal Church in Dundee and is active as a performer, teacher and translator. An extensive writer on matters relating to organ design and history, he contributes regularly to the Rhinegold journal, Choir and Organ and is the founder and project leader of the soon-to-launch ‘Sowne of Organe’ which seeks to document in sound and image the dwindling collection of historic organs in Scottish churches. He has recently been elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.


The Organ


The organ in St Salvator’s Chapel was built in 1973/4 by the Austrian firm of Gregor Hradetzky. It was designed in consultation with the noted British recitalist and broadcaster Geraint Jones and reflects the ethos of the Modernist movement in its use of materials, its physical and tonal structure, voicing techniques and winding system. The organ replaced a twice-rebuilt Henry Willis II organ of 1904.

The Art of Energy


Neil Tòmas Smith is a composer of chamber, orchestral and choral works based in Edinburgh. He is fascinated by the mechanics of sound, space and movement.

Neil studied in York and Stuttgart, the latter leading to a keen interest in German contemporary music. In Germany, he won first prize in the Acht Brücken Composition Competition with Gravitation, and his orchestral work, Habitus, was performed by the WDR Symphony Orchestra.

In 2017/18 Neil took part in the Royal Scottish National Orchestra’s Composers’ Hub and the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s Young Composers’ Programme simultaneously, creating the diptych Perihelion/Aphelion. The former was premiered at the Southbank Centre by members of the LPO conducted by Sir James MacMillan; the latter was chosen to be part of Scotland’s submission to the ISCM World Music Days in Shanghai.

Recently activities include an electronic album, MIDI Times & Spaces; the production of a CD in collaboration with Dark Inventions and Jonathan Sage, Strange Machines, which features Neil’s eponymous virtuoso work for solo clarinet; and a premiere of his work The Music Lesson by harpist Esther Swift at the Perth International Festival.

A debut portrait CD of Neil’s chamber music will be released in 2022 with support from the PRS Foundation, Creative Scotland, and the Hope Scott Trust.



Programme Note

The photograph Pylon by Ted Leeming shows the eponymous structure from below, looking skyward, so that a rhythmic repetition of diminishing squares is offered to the viewer. Pylons are part of the furniture of the landscape and, from what I can tell, this is a relatively rare example of a human-made object being the focus of Ted’s work.
When such overlooked objects are given the benefit of artistic presentation, it brings both their purpose and aesthetic potential mind: what it is used for, as well as its appearance and materials. It was these two considerations that informed this piece.


Firstly, the pylon defined the heavily metallic sound-world of the percussion quartet, thereby eschewing for the most part the drums and wooden percussion that are the cornerstone of most modern percussion music. Secondly, a sense of energy within materials – the feeling of great power despite little or no movement – defined some of the textures that arise in the piece. Finally, the basic idea of the diminishing squares is translated into rising musical figures of decreasing duration.


The piece was written for Thomas Lowe, with thanks.


Born in Lancashire, Emma Arandjelović is a composer, pianist, and cellist now based in Fife, Scotland. Her music has been described as “wonderfully lyrical and inventive” (Masquerade Music),and is influenced by diverse musical interests including French impressionism and jazz.

James Ross is a pianist and composer that pushes the boundaries of Scottish traditional music. James released his debut album on the Greentrax label, a mix of his piano arrangements of traditional and original material. Chasing the Sun, Ross's second recording, is a seven-movement suite, evoking a day's and a year's westward journey along Scotland's north coast. Originally co-commissioned by the Blas festival and Celtic Connections, it features Ross on piano with Mr McFall’s Chamber.
 
James collaborated with author James Robertson to create The Boy and the Bunnet, a new words-and-music piece created to introduce children to the Scots language and Scottish traditional music. He recently joined forces with prolific and celebrated author Alexander McCall Smith to compose These Are The Hands, a song cycle celebrating Scotland’s relationship with the sea and the land. 
 
The Flow Country
This suite of music celebrates the stark beauty of the unique and remarkable landscape of the north of Scotland. 
 
The Flow Country is a large expanse of peat bog in Caithness and Sutherland. It is the largest blanket peatland in Europe and is important not only for the habitats and the species that live there, but also as a vast carbon store which contributes to the global fight against climate change. 

Ian McQueen was born in London of Scottish parents and brought up near Glasgow, where he attended Coatbridge High School and studied trumpet at the RSAM&D with Enoch Jackson. He graduated from King’s College and the Royal College of Music in London after studies with John Lambert and Peter Maxwell Davies. The Mendelssohn Scholarship took him to study with Per Norgard in Denmark. Winning the BBC Collis Chamber Music Prize in 1982 led to “The Glen is Mine” being broadcast by the Royal Northern sinfonia, and The Gaudeamus Music Theatre Prize led to the music theatre work Mirrors of the Truth being premiered at the 1982 Holland Festival by the Netherlands Opera.
Ian is the composer of ten operas including two in Swedish (Fortunato and Judith) and commissions from The English National Opera, The Buxton Festival and Almeida Opera. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra premiered Fanfares and Nocturnes with Ian’s schooldays band, the Lanarkshire Youth Orchestra, in 1988, and the BBC Scottish Symphony gave the British premiere of Judith’s Doubt and Resolve (from the above opera) and commissioned his piano concerto Phaedrus in 1993.

More recently, a choral symphony Earthy Paradise (celebrating the life of William Morris) was commissioned by the BBC for the birthday of the BBC Symphony Chorus and premiered at the Barbican by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Andrew Davis in 2010

Ian now lives in Suffolk and his music is available from Ricordi (the opera East and West) and on the nkoda subscription music app. Recordings are on the Delphian label and on SoundCloud (as musiqueophile).


“Presence…COOL…Transcend”, subtitled “Music for a socially-distanced time”, was written during lockdown in the autumn of 2020 when people were asking “is Christmas cancelled?”; students were incarcerated in their dorms and loved ones in care homes sometimes couldn’t understand where their relatives had gone. I am an opera composer, and, at one level, the concerto is the most dramatic of all the classical musical forms we have inherited. The concertos of Vivaldi, Mozart, Berg and Sibelius all try to answer the question: “Who is this soloist, this force of nature?” Obviously, there is usually a WOW factor! But what about a soloist you can’t see – one who’s “shielding”, “isolating” and forcibly out of circulation; just like many musicians during the past 18 months? “Presence” explores this idea, while “COOL” is a contemplation on re-birth based on two classic standards from the Great American Songbook. “Transcend” celebrates a return to life with our soloist fully centre stage. The rhythm section transforms from movement to movement; introducing the marimba in “COOL” and the silvery glockenspiel in “Transcend”, which culminates in a ghostly version of the great protest ballad, “We Shall Overcome”. Edward McGuire is one of Scotland’s greatest musicians and I’m tremendously grateful to him for introducing me to the trumpet soloist, Bede Williams.

Linden Innes-Hopkins studied organ and piano at the Royal College of Music in London. She holds the FRCO Diploma, and an MA in Instrumental Teaching from the University of Reading. She has worked as organist in several London churches and, more recently, as Director of Music at St Mary’s, Welwyn in Hertfordshire.

While serving as Director of Music at Enfield Parish Church, she helped to steer a major restoration of the 3-manual organ there. The sum needed was £250,000, which was raised principally through a 5-year programme of fundraising events. Linden herself undertook a sponsored walk along the 200 miles of Offa’s Dyke. 

Walking is, in fact, one of Linden’s chief pleasures. She has undertaken sponsored walks to raise money for the St Albans Abbey Girls Choir when it was in its infancy under Andrew Parnell, and also later, when Simon Johnson was the choir’s Director.  She also enjoys accompanying choirs and has been associated with the Guildford Philharmonic Choir and the St Albans Bach Choir. More recently, she has been accompanist to the London-based Gloriana choir with whom she will be performing on Saturday 12 November at St James’s, Piccadilly. 

Throughout her career, Linden has had a thriving piano teaching practice in St Albans. During the lockdown periods, she used some of the gifted time to study Bach’s wonderful and wonderfully intricate Goldberg Variations. Steering the choir in Welwyn through virtual hymn recordings (which eventually resulted in a CD), and her piano pupils through performance grade video-ed exams were two of the many challenges she met and overcame.


The Organ


The organ in St Salvator’s Chapel was built in 1973/4 by the Austrian firm of Gregor Hradetzky. It was designed in consultation with the noted British recitalist and broadcaster Geraint Jones and reflects the ethos of the Modernist movement in its use of materials, its physical and tonal structure, voicing techniques and winding system. The organ replaced a twice-rebuilt Henry Willis II organ of 1904.

St Salvator’s Chapel Choir is the flagship choir of the University of St Andrews, Scotland. A mixed voice ensemble of around 30 students, its history extends back to the founding of the University in the early fifteenth century, when students were obliged to sing in the University’s chapel.  These choristers were referred to as the ‘Choristi Sanctiandree’. 

Today, under the direction of Claire Innes-Hopkins, the choir performs a broad repertoire spanning the six centuries of the University’s history. In addition to three sung services per week and extensive ceremonial duties, the choir enjoys a busy schedule of concerts, international tours and broadcasts on radio and TV, as well as appearances at international festivals including, most recently, the Thüringer Bachwochen (Germany), 


Haarlem Koorbiennale and Orgelfestival Holland (The Netherlands). Other recent tours have featured performances at Washington National Cathedral and Princeton University (USA) and with renowned baritone Peter Harvey in Sweden. In 2019 the choir toured throughout France including concerts in Burgundy, Marseille, and the Cathedral of Aix-en-Provence, and performed the opening concert of the International Organ Festival in Alkmaar, the Netherlands, subsequently broadcast on Dutch radio. 

Recordings on the University’s own internationally distributed CD label have included Salvator Mundi charting 100 years of English church music after Purcell, Bach and the Stile Antico, charting the evolution of the Credo from Bach’s Mass in B minor via works known to, and performed by, Bach during its composition and Annunciations featuring music by James MacMillan and six new works commissioned for the choir as part of the University’s TheoArtistry project. Most recently, the choir has released the first recording made under studio conditions of Sigismund von Neukomm’s Requiem in C minor, written for the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This recording was a collaboration with the Wallace Collection who perform on historic brass instruments.

Committed to the performance of new music, St Salvator’s Chapel Choir regularly commissions and performs works for both liturgical and secular contexts and during 2019 were Choir and Organ magazine’s Commissioning Partners. In recent years the choir has been privileged to work with musicians such as Sir James MacMillan, Robert Hollingworth, Paul Mealor and Dame Emma Kirkby.

The Haunted Piano Experience is a program brought to you by
the hard work of our Music Technology Department, along with
the fantastic and wonderfully talented UAH piano faculty, staff,
and students. Each piece was filmed live in Roberts Hall by
Matthew Westmeyer and student assistants. The selections were
then edited and spliced with original accompaniment and sound
effects, based on the original recordings. Students from MU207:
MIDI Production worked painstakingly to combine these wonderful
piano videos with data that controls our Yamaha DCFX concert
grand piano, along with the visual compositions you see projected
on the screen.
Special thanks to the UAH Theatre program for equipment

Lisa then accepted a touring job in Europe where she spent the next ten years playing music for Broadway shows, in chamber ensembles, teaching violin and working in organic gardens. An interest in the culinary arts took her to Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in London where she earned a cooking degree. A quick foray into the world of kitchens convinced her to return to music. In 2001, Lisa moved to Mobile, Alabama where she spent five years playing in the Mobile, Pensacola and Gulf Coast Symphony orchestras. She also taught violin privately and played with numerous choirs and small chamber ensembles. In 2003, Lisa founded Harmonic Strings, a string instrument business dedicated to helping students find their ideal instrument.

The Haunted Piano Experience is a program brought to you by the hard work of our Music Technology department, along with the fantastic and wonderfully talented UAH piano faculty, staff, and students! Each piece was filmed live in Roberts Hall by Matthew Westmeyer. The songs were then edited and spliced with original accompaniment and sound effects, based on the original recordings. Students from MU207: MIDI Production and MU305: Live Production and Engineering worked painstakingly to combine these wonderful piano videos with data that controls our Yamaha DCFX concert grand piano, along with the visual compositions you see projected on the screen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Thanks to Dr. Josh Pifer and Eric Page, from Valdosta State University, for their help in recording a performance from long distance!
Special thanks to Jules Chesna and Grace from MU305 for their musical contributions!
Special thanks to Robert rigsby for the Skelebus animation and voice work!

Thank you to the participants who arranged this work as well as those who sent in recordings. The piece will be performed in its entirety at ICSMA 2021 - we hope to see you there!

Below is the description provided by Professor John White:

""The folk song ""Hold On"" has a deep legacy in the history of the African American spiritual tradition, extending back into the 19th century. Known by many titles, due to varied texts (e.g., The Gospel Plow, Keep Your Hands on the Plow), it was one of many songs that was revamped or retexted and used by African Americans during post-WWII struggles for equality and civil rights. It is from this more recent history that the words ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize"" came to be used (adaptation attributed to activist Alice Wine in 1956), along with more contemporaneous verse texts.

""The opening lines about Paul and Silas make reference to a story found in Acts 16:19-26, from the New Testament. The song became a quintessential Civil Rights anthem, as the words speak of transcending oppression and persevering despite any struggle or obstacles arising in one's path. The words can speak for an individual as well as a group united in just cause. The power of the message applies as much to our life today as it did to previous generations.""","['music', 'Ithaca College Summer Music Academy 2020 | Hold On (Eyes on the Prize)', 'Summer Music Academy']"

High-intensity interval training (HIIT)

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves short bursts of intense exercise 
alternated with recovery periods. One of the biggest benefits of doing a HIIT workout 
is that you can get maximum health benefits in minimal time. 

High intensity interval training can improve heart health, increase 
fat loss and strengthen and tone your muscle. 

Try this 32 minute HIIT interval walking workout ..

----------------------------------------------------
THE WORKOUT
----------------------------------------------------

WARM UP: 
3 minutes slow walk

INTERVALS:
30 seconds walk fast - 30 seconds recovery walk
30 seconds walk fast - 20 seconds recovery walk
30 seconds walk fast - 10 seconds recovery walk
30 seconds walk fast - 10 seconds recovery walk
30 seconds walk fast - 20 seconds recovery walk
30 seconds walk fast - 30 seconds recovery walk

COOL DOWN: 
3 minutes slow walk

---------------------------------------------------------------
BENEFITS OF INTERVAL TRAINING
---------------------------------------------------------------

*  A workout of alternating high/low-intensity
    periods burns more calories than a workout
    of steady intensity.

*  It boosts metabolism significantly longer than
    a steady workout of even longer length.

*  It builds lean muscle tissue faster 
    than steady state training.

*  It does wonders for your heart.

is that you can get maximum health benefits in minimal time. 

High intensity interval training can improve heart health, increase 
fat loss and strengthen and tone your muscle.

BENEFITS OF QUICK WORKOUTS
-----------------------------------------------------

*  An increase in cardiometabolic health can be achieved with as little as a 4-minute workout routine. Several studies noted a positive effect of high intensity exercise in overweight and/or sedentary individuals. For those with very low levels of fitness, this can mean a significant decrease in mortality risk. 

*  Better control of blood sugar levels has been noted in overweight individuals following a 2-month short, but high intensity, period of exercise. Plus, short workouts don’t make you as exhausted as regular workouts, so your appetite won’t overwhelm you right after you finish.

*  Improved mental focus is noticeable after completing just 10 minutes of vigorous exercise. This makes short workouts a great option when you need to take a break between two mental activities.

High-intensity interval training (H.I.I.T.)

High-intensity interval training (H.I.I.T.) involves short bursts of intense exercise 
alternated with recovery periods. One of the biggest benefits of doing a H.I.I.T. workout 
is that you can get maximum health benefits in minimal time. 

High intensity interval training can improve heart health, increase 
fat loss and strengthen and tone your muscle. 

Try this 23 minute H.I.I.T. workout ..

----------------------------------------------------
THE WORKOUT
----------------------------------------------------

WARM UP: 
3 minutes (walk or jog)

INTERVALS:

30 seconds sprint 
15 seconds recovery walk / jog

Repeat 10 times
- 2 Rounds

COOL DOWN: 
3 minutes (walk or jog)

---------------------------------------------------------------
BENEFITS OF INTERVAL TRAINING
---------------------------------------------------------------

*  A workout of alternating high/low-intensity
    periods burns more calories than a workout
    of steady intensity.

*  It boosts metabolism significantly longer than
    a steady workout of even longer length.

*  It builds lean muscle tissue faster 
    than steady state training.

*  It does wonders for your heart.

Luckily, there are steps you can take to reduce your uptake of arsenic. 

Buy filtered water and filter it further by using a home filtration system. 
Avoid drinking juice. Blend organic fruits with almond milk or filtered water instead of juice.
Avoid all seafood. Omega 3’s are plentiful in fruits, vegetables, and ground flax and chia seeds

She provides insights as to why some people are proactive in their health decisions, and others let their health fail.
Changing one’s diet starts with mentally accepting change, giving up foods one enjoys, and putting changes into actions. Making big changes is hard, which I understand, but what I don’t understand is why some people won’t even make small changes to improve their health, when they are sick. 

Why do sick people ignore health advise and allow their health to deteriorate, when others are proactive. To seek answers to these questions and others I have, I asked licensed clinical psychologist Marcy Witkin-Lupo, author of “The Embrace of Spirit, A Woman’s Guide to Mind/Body Healing,” if I could interview her and record the conversation for my YouTube channel. She agreed to the 30-minute video which you can watch below.

Dr. Witkin-Lupo said there is no one definitive thing that makes one person amenable to change, but pain, a disease diagnosis, or a medical incident, is usually the driving source for change. For some people, a medical diagnosis will not make them change their diet or prompt them to exercise. Some people will have to have the heart attack before they start taking their heath seriously. Then, there are other people who still won’t make any changes to reduce their pain and exacerbate their symptoms and make them more susceptive to cancer and disease. 

Reasons for avoiding exercise and refusing to give up processed foods, fatty foods, red meat, dairy and animal products are varied and can include one or more of the following reasons:

• Denial – they are in denial of their medical condition, refusing to believe the diagnosis
• Disinformation – Some people don’t believe that diet and exercise can reverse disease and pain
• Negative attitude – they don’t believe they can change because other people tell them they 
        can’t
• Lack of confidence – they don’t believe they have the strength to change their habits
• Pain is tolerable – the pain isn’t bad enough to make changes
• Prefers instant gratification – would rather eat the burger now than put in the effort and time 
         to look & feel good six weeks, six months or a year from now
• Change is hard – changing ingrained habits is challenging
• Unsupportive family or friends – having people around you that push you to eat unhealthy 
        foods and engage in unhealthy habits makes it that much more difficult to make changes that 
        you don’t really want to make
• Unclear consequences – If the consequences of one’s actions or inactions aren’t clear, a 
        person may not be motivated to make lifestyle changes
• Undefined Why – To make permanent lifestyle changes, one needs to define why they are 
        making these changes. Everyone’s reason for why they are making drastic changes varies     
        from person to person, so your reason for giving up pizza and milkshakes, which may be 
       weight loss, is different from another person’s reason for avoiding dairy, which could be to stop 
       the painful Rheumatoid Arthritis Attacks.

I haven’t listed every aspect of the interview in this blog post. To listen to our interesting conversations, play the YouTube video.

Let me know why you exercise and/or try to eat healthy, or why you haven’t made these changes, I want to hear from you. If you have any additional insights as to why some people will make positive changes and others won’t, please write in the comments below; I want to hear multiple perspectives.

I try to limit my fat grams to 10 grams of fat per meal, with no more than 30 grams of fat per day.
If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of potatoes, tofu is more fattening than potatoes. 
There’s 4 grams of fat in tofu compared to .1 grams of fat in potatoes.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of bananas, tofu is more fattening than bananas. 
There’s 4 grams of fat in tofu compared to .3 grams of fat in bananas.

We know that vegetables and fruit are low in fat, so, let’s compare tofu, which is a bean, to garbanzo beans. If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of garbanzo beans, tofu is more fattening than garbanzos. There’s 4 grams of fat in tofu compared to 2.4 grams of fat in garbanzos.

People use tofu in place of animal meat so let’s compare tofu to leaner animal meats and fatty salmon.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of skinless chicken breast, tofu is slightly more fattening than chicken by .2 grams. The chicken has cholesterol; tofu has zero cholesterol.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of sirloin tip steak, which is considered a lean red meat, the steak and tofu are roughly around the same fat content, with steak being a mere .2 grams less fat. The steak, while low in fat, contains cholesterol; as a reminder, tofu has zero cholesterol.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of wild salmon, salmon is much more fattening than tofu.  Tofu has 4 grams of fat for 3 ounces and salmon has 6.9 grams of fat.

We know salmon is a fatty fish, so let’s compare tofu with a low-fat fish, such as tilapia. If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of tilapia, tofu is more fattening than tilapia by about 2 grams. 

If tofu is considered a high-fat food, let’s compare it to high-fat foods.

Most people don’t realize olives are high in fat. By comparing 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of black olives, olives have more than twice the fat than tofu. Tofu has 4 grams of fat. Olives have 9.3 grams of fat. Luckily no one eats 21 olives at a time.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of tortilla chips, tortilla chips are more than 4 times as fattening as tofu.  With tofu at 4 grams of fat, tortilla chips have 17.6 grams of fat!

3 ounces of tofu verses 3 ounces of McDonald’s French fries, the fries have almost 3 times as much fat as tofu. Tofu has 4 grams of fat, whereas the fries have 11.7 grams of fat.

Walnuts are a healthy, but high-fat food. By comparing 3 ounces of tofu to 3 ounces of walnuts, the walnuts are more than 14 times as fattening as tofu.  Tofu has 4 grams of fat and the walnuts have 56.7 grams of fat. Three ounces of walnuts are easy to eat, unfortunately. 

A 3-ounce, generic, low-fat ice cream bar has 6 grams of fat, so the low-fat ice cream has more fat than tofu.

If I compare 3 ounces of tofu, to a 3-ounce burger from sonic burger, because the sonic burger was on the list of the 13 healthiest fast-food burgers recommended by nutritionists, the burger has more than twice the fat as tofu.  A 3 oz sonic burger contains 10.5 grams of fat, whereas tofu has 4 grams of fat, for the same portion. Oh, and if a nutritionist considers an animal meat burger “healthy,” that nutritionist should have their certification revoked.

Oil is the highest fat food, so let’s see how tofu holds up to olive oil. Three ounces of olive oil, which is a little over 6 tablespoons, is a whopping 85 grams of fat, whereas the tofu at 4 grams of fat, seems tiny. If you want to lower the fat in your diet, and reduce belly and bodyfat, avoid all oils.

In conclusion, beans and most fruits and vegetables are lower in fat than tofu, so tofu isn’t a low-fat food. 

Tofu has around the same amount of fat as some lean animal proteins. 

Tofu is much lower in fat than high-fat foods like olives, salmon, chips, fries, nuts, burgers, and oil.
The verdict: tofu is NOT a high-fat food

The theory that soy has estrogenic effects and increases estrogen levels and cancer risk has been debunked. The phytoestrogens in soy are actually protective against cancer, and those who eat more soy have a lowered risk of cancer. 

Animal milk and animal products increase estrogen and contain estrogen, bacteria, hormones, cholesterol, viruses, and saturated animal fat. Soy milk does not contain estrogen (or the gross items above), nor does it increase estrogen levels. Soy milk is a healthy alternative to animal milks.

There are soy products that are harmful to health. The soy you want to avoid is GMO soy and isolated soy protein, which is found is protein powders, processed foods and bars; which is why I only buy certified organic tofu and edamame.

Soy is good for you and reduces cancer risk. You can eat soy every day, but it is a food that's moderate in fat, so you keep your portion size to no more than six ounces per meal, which will contain about eight grams of fat. Pair tofu with vegetables and you'll have a nutritious, health-promoting meal.

UC5TKWxKKl1IRfTZsVgS0ziA,Is there a cure for Alzheimer’s | The End of Alzheimer’s book review,Is there a cure for Alzheimers The End of Alzheimers book review,nIzqYLoHY-M,2022-10-15T15:00:36Z,19,False,0,0,17:57,"There is not a cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s possible to reverse and prevent Alzheimer’s through nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, and detoxification. In the book, “The End of Alzheimer’s Program. The First Protocol to Enhance Cognition and Reverse Decline at any age,” Dr. Dale Bredesen outlines his convoluted, multi-faceted strategies to reverse and prevent Alzheimer’s. 

His list of suggestions is so long and so confusing, someone should seek medical advice instead of following the steps in this book to customize the strategies to what one really needs.

He calls his diet a plant-based ketogenic diet, but it’s not plant-based, and encourages animal products from fish and eggs (which are extremely high in cholesterol). A plant-based diet is either entirely vegan or where the majority of calories come from whole plants. Most of the calories in this diet plan comes from fat (animal fats and oils), preferring MCT oil. 

Per the Mayo Clinic, “saturated fat is known to raise cholesterol levels, linked with heart disease risk.” All oils raise cholesterol levels, some worse than others. Healthier does not mean healthy though. “…research has found that cholesterol levels have more to do with the fat you eat, namely saturated and trans fats,” which is another reason to reduce saturated fats (1).

Dr. Bredesen recommends starting with 75% of the calories coming from fats like oil, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, and avocado (pg 193). He says, “animal protein is optional,” which it isn’t, and that a person could modify his diet plan to be 100% vegan (pg 179). 
 
Protein converts into amino acids in the body. Amino acids are acidic, yet he recommends more protein, contradicting himself through the book; even admitting that protein hinders healing.

He states that “dairy products cause inflammation…” (which is true) “…a key driver of Alzheimer’s…” yet contradicting himself repeatedly, saying it is okay to eat ghee, yogurt, kefir, cheese, and milk, which are all dairy products, contain salt, saturated fat, and hormones linked to cancer and can trigger autoimmune attacks (pg 173).

He says to limit persimmons (pg 164) and other fruits and vegetables that are high on the glycemic index, even though these foods are excellent sources of prebiotic fibers and have demonstrated neuroprotective properties. 

When someone eats a low carbohydrate diet and adding fat to one’s diet, that makes insulin resistance worse because excess fat (and animal protein) is the cause of obesity, heart disease, and Type-2 diabetes, among other life-threatening conditions. 
 
When cells and organs become saturated with fat, more insulin is made by the pancreas because it must work harder to push insulin into the cells because the cells are full of fat. 

His book is full of faulty advice because he doesn’t understand the cause of diabetes, autoimmune disease, heart disease and weight gain. What triggers most diseases are animal products, not eating enough fruits and vegetables, and eating foods high in fat, and low in micronutrients and fiber.

He states that people who have diabetes, heart disease and hypertension are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s so if those conditions are reversed, it could prevent Alzheimer’s, yet his high-fat diet plan promotes insulin resistance, fat storage and blood sludge (blood saturated with fats). 

The reason why his diet works for some people is that it reduces the amount of animal protein, gets rid of flours, sugar, desserts, pasta, refined carbs, bread and processed foods. If someone reduces calories and inflammatory foods, they usually get better. 

A diet that reverses diabetes, heart disease and reduces one’s likeliness of cancer, is a diet that is low in fat (10-15% of one’s daily calories), low in protein 10% (preferable from whole plants) and high in fruits and vegetables. 

You can reverse Type-2 diabetes, heart disease by limiting fat, avoid all oils, animal products, and eat large greens salads and lots of whole-carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables.

Dr. Bredesen doesn’t understand how detrimental fat and animal protein is to the human body and his recommendations can make people sicker. He doesn’t understand the science because he relies on studies funded by pharmaceutical companies, and the dairy and meat industry. 
 
If you want to learn more about nutrition, read, “The China Study,” “Mastering Diabetes,” “The Starch Solution” by Dr. McDougall, “Your Body in Balance” by Dr. Neal Barnard, my book “The High-Five Diet” published in 2021 which also contains plant-based recipes, and the movies “Forks Over Knives,” “The Game Changers,” “Eating You Alive.”

1. Standing hip lift and drop. Stand, lift one leg at 90 degrees, lift hip up and down for 10 reps. Repeat on other side.
2. Side leg lifts. Lay on your side, both legs are bent. Put head in your hand, place other hand in front of you, with palm on the floor. Tap top knee to the matt and lift upwards and back 45 degrees. 10 reps.
3. 45-degree side leg lifts. Repeat #2 on other side & then complete #3.
4. Bird-dog. On all fours, lift one leg up and tap down for 10 reps. Repeat on other side.
5. Rope pull-through. Stand with feet wider than hip width, with bent knees. Envision a rope is behind you and you are pulling the rope straight forward. Hinge from the hips and squeeze your butt when you stand up with knees slightly bent the whole time. Keep your back flat as in a deadlift.
6. Inner thigh leg lifts. Lay on your side. Top leg is bent with that foot back on the matt. The bottom leg is bent, bring that knee to your abs and kick straight, toe pointed internally. 10 reps. (If you have fibromyalgia, you may want to skip this one because the pressure on the lower hip is quite intense in this exercise)

I rated 14 diets from worst to best based on their fiber content, micronutrients, phytochemicals, acidity, alkalinity, if they promote or reduce inflammation, and propensity to trigger or reverse diseases. 

Diets 1-8 are the worst diets for your health as they contain low fiber content, low micronutrients, have a high acidity content, promote inflammation, and trigger numerous diseases and autoimmune conditions. The absolute worst being the carnivore diet. 

Worst for health

1. carnivore diet
2. Atkins diet
3. Standard American diet aka SAD Diet
4. Junk food Vegan diet (vegan ice cream, French fries, vegan cheese, oils, vegan cookies) 
5. Ketogenic diet
6. Low-carb raw vegan diet (low in fruit, high in fats)
7. Gourmet raw vegan diet (high in nuts, dried fruit, agave, dehydrated foods) 
8. Paleo diet

Diets 9-11 are the better for your health, compared to diets 1-8, because they contain more fiber, more micronutrients, have a lower acidity content, promote less inflammation, and trigger fewer diseases and autoimmune conditions. The Mediterranean diet would be the healthiest of this bunch if only a little bit of oil, bread, pasta, and fish is eaten, with the remaining calories coming from fruits and vegetables.  

Better for health: 

9. Whole-30 diet
10. Vegetarian diet (high in cheese, lots of pasta & bread)
11. Mediterranean Diet

The top three diets are listed below because they are high in fiber and micronutrients, alkalizing, anti-inflammatory, and can reverse most diseases and autoimmune conditions. Since everyone reacts differently to foods, a low-fat plant-based diet that is oil-free might makes most people feel fantastic by reversing Type-2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease (amongst others), while other people only get well on a whole-food raw vegan diet.

All you need is a mat, a set of light dumbbells, and water. I’m drinking zero calorie mint tea.

I’m using three different sets of dumbbells, 8’s, 10’s and 12’s, but one set is sufficient, just do a few more reps or squeeze the muscles more if the exercises are easy (I’m guessing they will be more challenging than you realize). 

If you have difficulty with balance, have a chair nearby to hold on to. 

Stop at the first sign of pain. Go at your level. Don’t hold your breath on any of these exercises.  

Here are the exercises in order:

Warm-up: fast marching 

Workout:
1. Leg lifts and lowers to work the hips and gluteus medias (aka the side butt). Lay on your side, knees bent. With a pointed toe, lift the top knee upwards to the ceiling, leaving the top toes pressed against the bottom foot. Reverse the rotation by bringing the top knee down to the bottom thigh, while bringing the toes up to the ceiling this time. Perform a total of 20 reps. (see video below to see the exercise and to follow along)
2. Reverse short and long lunges with or without dumbbells, your choice. 8 or more reps on each side.
3. Bridge hold with alternating heel lifts. 30 seconds
4. Bridge hold. Lift both heels up and down. 10-30 seconds

8. Same as #6, but pulse the same leg at the top for 10 seconds or until failure.
9. Same as #6, but hold leg at the top for 10 seconds.
10. Two push-ups, then stand up, perform 5 lateral shoulder raises. Repeat for 3 sets.
11. Triceps shoulder crushers. Lay on your back. With dumbbells in each hand, flare the elbows out to the sides; the triceps should touch the floor. Bring dumbbells towards the shoulders. The dumbbells do not need to touch the shoulders. Repeat for 8 reps or until failure
12Pull-overs in a bridge with 5-count eccentrics and 1-count concentric. 8 reps. Lay on your back. Bend your knees with feet flat on the floor. With one dumbbell in each hand, press the weights over your chest. With straight arms, lower the weights to the floor, then bring the weights back up over your chest. Repeat.
13. Narrow shoulder press with dumbbells. 8 reps. Jump up or pop up, for the last 7 reps, for a total of 15 reps. Land softly.
14. Calf raises with 90-degree dumbbell biceps hold for 20 reps. 
15. Biceps curls for 8-10 reps with calf raises.
16. Ten plank jacks, or tap the outer toes if this plyometric exercise is not suited to you.
17. Lay on your back, legs extended with a slight bend in your knees. Put your hands behind your head and perform 10 small circles with your upper body. This strengthens the upper abdominal muscles. Then lift one leg and perform 5 more upper body circles. Repeat this sequence on the other direction. This strengthening the upper and lower abdominal muscles.

I’ve never shared a recipe from either of my two cookbooks on YouTube or on my blog, but I thought I would demonstrate how I make this low-fat, plant-based, oil-free, nut-free, vegan casserole so you literally have a taste from my book.

Ingredients:
Russet and/or Yukon gold potatoes, diced, skin on
About 7 dashes of salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, paprika, pinch of cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
2 boxes tofu, drained and pressed
¼ cup Coconut aminos
1 yellow or white onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and chopped
¼ to ½ cup Kalamata olives, sliced in half
Hot sauce to taste

Place potatoes on a large rectangular glass baking dish and sprinkle with water and toss. Add spices and herbs and toss with your hands. Heat oven at 375 degrees. Put seasoned potatoes in oven. Check potatoes every 15 minutes, flipping them with a spatula to cook all sides evenly.

While potatoes are cooking, crumble tofu with your hands into a glass dish and mixed with coconut aminos. Cover. Place in refrigerator to marinate. 

Put chopped onion on a heated pan. Add 3-4 tablespoons of water and stir with a spatula until the onions are translucent. Add bell pepper and olives to pan, mix vegetables, and remove from heat. After the potatoes have been cooking 45 minutes, add the tofu and vegetables. Gently toss the potatoes with the tofu and other vegetables. Cook another 15-30 minutes until the potatoes are cook through.

We’re bombarded with how great a Mediterranean diet is for heart health, but I knew a low-fat vegan diet was superior and now, there’s proof. A 16-week study with 62 overweight people compared a low-fat vegan diet comprised of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, with a Mediterranean diet, that contained those same whole foods, but with added olive oil, fish, and low-fat dairy. 

The vegans lost more bodyfat, and the vegans lowered their cholesterol levels. Those eating fish, dairy and “heart-healthy” olive oil on the Mediterranean diet were not able to lower their cholesterol levels. 

Even though the vegans were eating a higher carbohydrate diet with lower fats, their blood sugars improved.

Medical doctor, Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee, said, “In a randomized, controlled trial, the Mediterranean diet caused no weight loss at all. The problem seems to be the inclusion of fatty fish, dairy products, and oils. In contrast, a low-fat vegan diet caused significant and consistent weight loss.”

UC5TKWxKKl1IRfTZsVgS0ziA,Is oil fattening | Is coconut oil healthy or not￼,Is oil fattening Is coconut oil healthy or not,27XMqbv6MsQ,2022-09-11T15:59:07Z,38,False,2,0,9:56,"I have a certification in Fitness Nutrition, am a Certified Fitness trainer, Certified Strength and Fitness Coach, Certified Plant-Based Grassroots Ambassador, and a published author of four books. The High-Five Diet, is about my story of sickness & health and how diet plays a front roll in nutrition.

Today’s topic is oil. Are oils healthy or harmful? What about olive oil?

You’ve probably heard your doctor tell you that saturated fats should be minimized and are harmful to your health. All oils contain saturated fats. Saturated fats increase cholesterol levels, heart disease and Type-2 diabetes.

My cholesterol level was 201, now it’s 148 due to my low-fat diet. An IDEAL total cholesterol should be below 150.

I have Type-1 diabetes. My blood sugar A1C was 10.2, which is an average of 240, now it’s 5.5, which is an average of 120 and I eat more carbs now.

Fats, such as oil, block glucose from entering cells, which makes blood sugars rise. It’s the fat that’s the problem, not the fruit or the potatoes.

Fat makes people fat and ill. Excess fat causes ED, high blood pressure, poor circulation, hair loss, poor healing and back pain.

Back pain is commonly caused by sitting too much, but back pain may also be caused by poor circulation from excess fat hindering blood flow to the lumbar spine.

A high-fat diet is the cause of so much illness, so omitting oil is one step in the right direction.

Oil is a processed food that is 100% fat. Dr. McDougall is correct that the “fat you eat is the fat you wear.” People are fatter today because the rate of oil consumption has gone up. One fatty meal impairs blood vessel function for up to 8 hours after you eat it, which is why it’s called “sludge blood.” 

Oils cause endothelial cell dysfunction and insulin resistance.
When adding oil to the diet, red blood cells shape changes from smooth to having spikes, so blood doesn’t flow as well. 
Oils cause red blood cells to become deformed. 


All oils are toxic and coconut oil is extremely high in saturated fat.

Olive oil is pure fat and contains saturated fat.

Olive oil is not a health food. The reason why a Mediterranean diet is better for health is because they eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and less meat. Mediterranean diets show improvements in health not because of olive oil, but in spite of it.

When a study compares olive oil to pork fat or coconut oil, it’s a healthier fat, but it’s not a “healthy fat.” 

Nutritionists and doctors who take additional extensive nutritional training beyond what’s taught in medical school, or take the time to look at past studies and historical data, like Dr. Esselstyn, a trained surgeon from Yale, conducted a study that showed patients who adopted a low-fat diet reversed severe coronary heart disease, and over 99% avoided future cardiac events, one of the longest longitudinal studies of its kind, advises against consuming oil.

Dr. McDougall, a clinical instructor at four medical schools, who wrote the famous book, “The Starch Solution,” and Dr. Klapper, who travels to medical schools around the country to teach how plant-based nutrition can reverse disease, Dr. Greger, a graduate of Cornel and an internally recognized speaker on nutrition who wrote the New York Times bestselling book “How not to Die,” Dr. Alan Goldhamer, who wrote the popular book, The Pleasure Trap, and operates True North Health Center, all advocate an oil-free diet. 

We can improve our health at any age. My mom, who is 80, had high blood pressure. The medication caused muscle weakness and painful muscle cramps. She stopped eating animal products and oils. Now she is completely off blood pressure medication and is no longer in pain. 

People of all ages, all over the country, are adopting an SOS-free diet, which means they avoid salt, oil, and sugar, but do you know what’s worse for your health than salt and sugar? Oil.

This new SOS-free diet trend is growing, is here to stay, and more people will be demanding that their meals be made without oil. 

 
Food can be sautéed, stir-fried, baked, and roasted without oil.
There are healthy alternatives to butter, margarine, and oil. 

The best part about this is, your food tastes better without oil. Your food is not heavy or weighed down. You won’t have a stomachache from having eaten oil-laden food. The flavors from vegetables pop when oil isn’t added.

Restaurants and other establishments are embracing oil-free cooking because it saves money and kitchens are cleaner.

Aluminum is a neurotoxin and can trigger cancer. We absorb aluminum from drinking beverage from aluminum cans, cooking our food in aluminum pots and pans, allowing our food to touch aluminum foil, taking antacids, pain killers, medicines, adding baking powder to food, and wearing antiperspirants. 

There are steps you can take to reduce your aluminum absorption and remove aluminum from your tissues. 

1. Bake your food on parchment lined paper instead of aluminum foil
2. Use aluminum-free cookware, like stainless steel.
3. Store your food in glass containers. 
4. Buy aluminum-free baking powder as baking powder has the highest concentration of aluminum out of all the foods.
5. If you need an antacid, take Tums.
6. Minimize use of painkillers and medicines, when possible.
7. Wear deodorant instead of antiperspirant. Anti-perspirants contain aluminum because aluminum blocks sweat.
8. Eat a low-fat vegan diet, which will lower aluminum concentrations.
9. Drink silica tea which acts as a chelator by removing aluminum from your body

Ingredients:

• 2 handfuls washed mixed greens
• Handful of sugar snap peas, ends removed, cut in half
• 2 oranges, peeled, sliced in half, pith removed, and cut into bite-size pieces
• 2 nectarines, cut into bite-size pieces, toss out the pit
• 2 teaspoons tahini

Oils are highly concentrated, processed foods that cause inflammation, weight gain and can trigger Type-2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.

There are a couple of techniques you can do; one is the dry cooking method, which just takes a little more attention because you’re going to have to stir the vegetables more frequently and watch them to make sure they don’t burn. 

I prefer to use a liquid so I don’t burn it; the liquid options that are best are: vegetable stock, water or wine. All methods taste the same,  but if you cook with the wine, your house will smell absolutely delicious, so if you have guests over you may want to use the wine to sauté. If you’re concerned about alcohol,  not to worry because you’ll be cooking out the alcohol. 

Heat a stainless steel pan to medium-high heat until the pan is warm to the touch (don't touch the pan though!). Add vegetables, distributing them evenly. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of liquid of choice (water, wine or vegetable stock) to the vegetables in the pan. If the water completely evaporates and the vegetables are not cooked enough, add one or more tablespoons of liquid at a time to cook it thoroughly.","['How to cook without oil', 'How to sauté without oil', 'How to stirfry without oil', 'Low-fat plant based cooking methods', 'Shorts', 'YouTube shorts']"
UC5TKWxKKl1IRfTZsVgS0ziA,Caroline Girvan diet | What does Caroline Girvan eat?,Caroline Girvan diet What does Caroline Girvan eat,LxCR51Tb1-8,2022-08-13T15:00:10Z,136,False,1,6,9:6,"Caroline Girvan, a fitness model, calls herself a “nutrition expert.” When I googled, “What makes Caroline Girvan a nutrition expert?” My search didn’t come up with an answer to that question, so I tried a different question. I typed, “What are Caroline Girvan’s credentials?” Answer: She’s a “certified personal trainer.” Certified trainers do have to read a chapter about nutrition, which is incomplete and usually inaccurate; that doesn’t make her an expert in nutrition.

I am a certified personal trainer and have a certification in fitness nutrition; I am a certified strength and conditioning coach, a certified plant-based grassroots Ambassador, a published author of four books, one a cookbook, and the other teaches nutrition and weight loss. 

In her diet plan, she recommends the following:

Breakfast: eggs, toast, avocado, and fruit. Fruits are extremely nutritious and contain fiber, nutrients, and water so that’s a fantastic food choice. For someone trying to lose weight, they should avoid or limit avocados which are high in fat. Eggs are high in fat and cholesterol and should not be any diet plan. Toast is a processed food, but if it’s whole grain and is gluten free, it’s fine for most people to eat. 

Snack: protein shake or Greek yogurt. Protein shakes usually contain chemicals, toxic sweeteners, and isolated soy or dairy protein. Dr. McDougall says all protein powders are toxic because the protein has been isolated (molecularly taken apart, the fiber, carbohydrate and fat removed). The probiotics in all yogurts are usually inactive, and what little remains is worthless. We don’t need to add shakes or yogurt to our diets since we generally already eat excessive amounts of protein. (I advise people to try not to snack between meals as snacks add up fast).

Lunch: salmon, brown rice, and broccoli. 
Salmon is a high-fat food. All fish contain mercury, PCB’s, microplastics, cholesterol and toxic chemicals. Fish is poor protein choice. I used to eat salmon too, but now, when I want salmon, I make baked tofu “salmon” with nori. Tofu is high in protein, and the nori seaweed contains iodine and omega 3s. 

Brown rice contains quite a bit of arsenic so I would choose another grain, like quinoa instead. Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable and something everyone should eat often.

Mid-day snack: rice cakes, peanut butter, apple. I’m not a fan of rice cakes since they taste like cardboard and puffed rice is processed. Peanut butter is a high fat food, which is not recommended for people trying to lose weight. Apples are awesome and contain healthy phytonutrients. People should eat more apples!

Dinner: chicken breast, lentil pasta, marinara sauce, spinach. This dinner would have been a good choice except for the chicken breast, which is full of saturated animal fat and estrogen hormones, which makes it hard to lose weight.

Snack: cottage cheese or chocolate. It appears she’s choosing cottage cheese due to its high protein content, but most people have digestive issues with dairy because us humans weren’t supposed to consume baby bovine fluid. 

Dark chocolate is delicious, but chocolate bars are high in fat, and contain sugar, which is inflammatory and additive, and can lead to overconsumption. 

A diet so low in whole carbohydrates, would make it difficult for most people to gain muscle, feel full and satisfied, and have enough energy to complete a difficult workout.

Her diet is lacking in in fiber; fiber is essential for good gut health, so I recommend she add more fruit, definitely berries, and more vegetables, like sweet potatoes and beets, to her food plan, add in beans and lentils for heart-healthy protein and carbohydrates for fuel, and get rid of the dairy and animal products, which are acidic and inflammatory (not ideal for building muscle or losing weight). 

She recommends eating six times a day. Eating more frequently can lead to weight gain, not weight loss, and it doesn’t allow the body enough time between meals for repair because it’s spending more time digesting food. I recommend people eat less frequently, limiting their meals to no more than three times a day.

To sum up Caroline’s diet, it’s a high-fat, high-protein diet, low in carbohydrates, low in fiber, low in micronutrients, high in mercury, hormones, and toxins. The reason why she isn’t fat from eating all this fat is that her portions aren’t huge, and she doesn’t eat more calories than she burns off. Fat doesn’t contain fiber or nutrients. 

Being slim, muscular and/or beautiful doesn’t mean someone’s diet is healthy. 

Even if you or I exercised and ate exactly like Caroline, we wouldn’t look like her. Proper nutrition, consistent exercise with progressive overload is key for a fit, muscular body but genes play a huge role in determining how one looks.

Caroline’s diet plan is better than most out there, but it not health promoting, will leave most people hungry, and have trouble following. All-in-all, I would grade her diet a “B-.”","['What does Caroline Girvan eat', 'Caroline Girvan diet', 'Is Caroline Girvan vegan', 'What’s Caroline Girvan’s diet?', 'Caroline Girvan diet plan', 'How often does Caroline Girvan eat', 'weight loss diet plan', 'weight lifting diet plan', 'weight lifting diet program']"

We were tired of political posturing and chest thumping, sterile meeting rooms with emotionless speakers.  We longed for the days of sweat, heart, and passion for the Iron Game - all of the gut feelings that we experienced the first time we laid our hands on iron. We saw a very real need for extraordinary people from different fitness disciplines to share their ideas and techniques, rather than stay within their comfortable, sheltered shell of proficiency. 

On a hot summer day in 2008, Richard Sorin was asked what he would want for his 58th birthday. He quickly replied that he would want, more than anything, to have friends of the Iron Game come to Sorinex HQ for a day of lifting and learning, coaching and sharing, eating and drinking.  Before we knew it, 38 people from SC, AZ, TX, OH, and many other states came through the door.  Twelve hours later, people went home exclaiming that they had an amazing time and simply wanted more - more of that homegrown uniqueness, that authentic enjoyment of this Iron Game.  Eight Summer Strongs later, in 2015, over 500 attendants rubbed elbows with some of the most renowned coaches and athletes who volunteered to present and compete. 

SummerStrong has always been a labor of love, and an opportunity to give back to the Iron Game.  It's about learning and giving back.  It's about honoring effort and creating camaraderie.  Its about celebrating strength and the strong.",

Luke Day // Luke Day is the current Head Football Strength and Conditioning Coach at the University of South Carolina. Previously Luke was the Head Strength and Conditioning coach at Marshall. Day initially joined Marshall as the head strength and conditioning coach in January of 2016, a position he held for three seasons. He was recommended by Scott Sinclair, Day’s predecessor, who in three years transformed the Herd strength and conditioning philosophy during a run of three-straight seasons of 10 or more wins by Coach Doc Holliday’s team. Day and Sinclair – who moved from MU to the strength and conditioning director’s role at Georgia – previously worked together at UCF under veteran strength coach Ed Ellis. “Luke comes highly recommended from people I trust,” said Coach Beamer. “I spoke to a lot of strength coaches about our position and after spending 90 minutes on the phone with him, there was no doubt in my mind he was the best candidate by far. He has a great vision for developing the players, both in strength and conditioning and in the mental aspects, which is critical.”

Jud Logan burned bright, shone light, and planted roots of hope and curiosity more than most any man I’ve met. He had a magnetic way of attracting the inquisitive, and guiding the hungry. His passion for strength and human performance was only outweighed by his passion for people and their ability to wring out every last ounce of potential. He took nobodies and made them champions, and effortlessly garnered the love and admiration of all he shared space and time with. You simply wanted to be beside him. Energizing, comforting, inspiring, calming. His positivity was nothing like I’ve ever experienced, and doubt I will again. I am beyond blessed to have Jud as a hero, competitor, coach, mentor, friend and trusted peer.
The void that is created with his passing is immense, but what is immeasurable and in total “Jud fashion” is the legacy left behind in the hundreds of people he ignited and fueled. He loved his kids dearly, and I speak for countless when I say we were all his kids.
Jud’s passing makes today darker, but only until we recognize around us the incredible illuminating fires he lit, that will continue to burn for generations, which has and will make the world brighter than before.

Benefits
 
The Sorinex Adjustable Jammer Arms were designed with future innovation in mind. In the late 2000’s, Sorinex introduced the first ever rack attached Jammer Arms. Many coaches wanted to utilize traditional jammer press movements but did not want to sacrifice floor space in their weight rooms. Sorinex created an innovative training solution that has now evolved in the Adjustable Jammer Arms. As coaching philosophies changed and new training environments were created, the Jammer Arms found their home. Fast forward to 2018 and the Jammer Arms are replacing big clunky leverage pieces with modularity, functional safety, and space-saving movements. Bilateral and unilateral movements. Dynamic, variable, or isometric. Standing or seated. Press, row, squat, or pull. Your training options are limitless. Thus, a new proven concept; room for constant growth, change, and efficient training time use was created and forever changed the strength training equipment world.

The talk discussed developing faster and more robust endurance runners using strength training techniques.

Distance running performance is primarily limited by physiological attributes, however neuromuscular factors are also known to be important. Various strength training modalities offer a means of improving neuromuscular qualities, which can potentially improve distance running performance via several important underlying physiological determinants.

The prevalence of overuse injury in the running community is relatively high, therefore strategies to mitigate against the risk of injury are of interest to athletes and their coaches. Several intrinsic risk factors associated with common injuries in distance runners are potentially modifiable with strength training activities. Addressing these risk factors with a targeted and individualised programme of supplementary exercises is therefore likely to lower injury risk.

In this talk, Richard provided an overview of the evidence that supplementary strength training may be of benefit to distance runners from a performance and injury risk perspective. The talk also provided recommendations concerning the prescription of appropriate strength and conditioning activities for runners.",

Timed to coincide with the UEFA Women’s EURO taking place in England, the talk discussed the wellbeing, health and social values of male versus female football in Europe.

In recent years, public policy has promoted sport participation across Europe because of benefits to health, social capital and wellbeing. This talk reported research that seeks to answer two questions connected with football in Europe:

How does participation in different types of football affect male and female social capital, wellbeing, and health?
What monetary values can be assigned to these effects?

The focus on football reflects it being the largest participation team sport, that it can take place in a variety of formal and informal contexts and that it is a sport that is rapidly developing for females and challenging existing patterns of sport participation. Addressing the research questions in this context can inform future investment by governing bodies.

Whilst it has long been argued that greater sport and physical activity participation can help to reduce health care costs, increasingly social return on investment analyses have emerged. These investigate the case for increased investment in sport aimed at drawing down the benefits associated with sports beyond the economic impact.",

The talk discussed a life course approach to menopause.

The subject of menopause, its symptoms and treatments has become a more prevalent topic in recent years. In this NCSEM online lecture series we myth bust and outline what the evidence says around aspects of menopause.

A life course approach seeks to understand how earlier life experiences and exposures influence menopause and subsequent health, and therefore it offers potential for early intervention and prevention of menopause symptoms. In this talk Professor Hardy highlights how reproductive characteristics, from starting periods to menopause, are inter-related, and how health, socioeconomic position, and lifestyle in earlier life are associated with timing of menopause, menopausal symptoms, and the decision to take hormone therapy. She then outlines why these prior differences between women matter in understanding the relationship between menopause and later life health.",

The subject of menopause, its symptoms and treatments has become a more prevalent topic in recent years. In this NCSEM online lecture series we myth bust and outline what the evidence says around aspects of menopause.

In this talk Professor Hogervorst covered what we know about the brain and menopause. Should we take hormones for the complaints of brain fog, problems with memory and concentration, the mood swings and irritability and loss of libido? Can hormones protect against dementia?  If that is so when should we take these and for how long?

The talk discussed the use of Omega-3s for the management or prevention of cardiometabolic disease.

Cardiometabolic disease is a term used to describe largely preventable lifestyle-related conditions like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver.

Omega-3s are mainly found in oily fish, nuts and seeds, and have long been linked to good heart health. Roughly a third of us in the UK consume fish oil supplements, for various reasons, but do we really know what their effects are, what amount we should be taking and for how long?

This talk gives us the opportunity to delve into the evidence surrounding use of Omega-3s (in supplement or diet form) for the management or prevention of cardiometabolic disease.

The talk discussed menopause and its impact on the heart.

Before menopause, cardiovascular disease risk is lower in women than men.  After menopause, cardiovascular disease risk increases in women in association with the loss of the cardioprotective effects of estrogen.  In this talk Dr O’Donnell will examine the role of estrogen in cardiovascular health in women, and will discuss why replacement of estrogen with hormone therapy during menopause is not indicated for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

I don’t want to be different. I don’t want to be seen as disabled.”

This public lecture was delivered by Dr David Maidment, Lecturer in Psychology at Loughborough University, in May 2022. The talk discussed improving physical activity in older adults with hearing loss.

Hearing loss in older adults is independently associated with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and dementia. Evidence suggests that physical activity may play a role in this association, since older adults with hearing loss are more likely to be physically inactive or sedentary.

No studies to date have examined how physical activity can be successfully facilitated in this population. As a result, this presentation outlined the work that has been completed at Loughborough University assessing the associations between hearing loss, chronic disease risk and physical activity. It also discussed ongoing work involving the development a digital behaviour change intervention that aims to improve physical activity in older adults with hearing loss so they can live longer, healthier lives.",

It is becoming increasingly apparent that physical activity and exercise play a key role in reducing cancer risk and helping to improve patient outcomes, but we don’t fully understand what’s going on at the cellular and molecular level. This presentation focused on how exercise prevents cancer in the first place, and why exercise is important for immune function in those living with and beyond cancer, as well as the outline recommendations for exercise.

It’s the first national assessment students have participated in since the pandemic began, and it revealed the steepest declines in student math scores since the federal testing program began in the early 1990s. In reading, students’ scores were knocked back by a decade or more.

Achievement dropped for all students: boys and girls, white, Black, and Hispanic students, students in poverty and wealthy students. And while top performers fared the best, struggling learners suffered the steepest declines.

The devastating portrait of student achievement painted by the results contrasts with parents’ view of how their children are doing in school. Ninety percent say their children are working at grade level or better.

But much of what’s needed – resources, time, capacity – are already in short supply in schools.
To help address those barriers, The Aspen Institute created an action plan for K-12 schools that examines the policy changes and resources schools need, and the actions they can take to address what’s to come.

“Everybody will have a role to play in making a difference,” said Laura Schifter, senior fellow at the Aspen Institute.

For the second season, our first episode of the International Curriculum Specialist Series focuses on Health and Wellbeing, particularly with social and emotional learning (or SEL). Lee Hendricks, Head of the International Middle Years Curriculum (IMYC) at Fieldwork Education, interviews lead author and Principal Scientific Advisor Molly Lawlor and Dido Balla, the Head of Education for MindUP, an evidence-based social-emotional learning program grounded in neuroscience.

Molly and Dido discuss what exactly is social and emotional learning (or SEL) and what it should look and feel like in the classroom. They share some of the key skills that every school should emphasise in an SEL curriculum or program. They also explain some strategies that have been found to be the most effective ways to reduce stress, something both educators and students can appreciate knowing and implementing in these challenging times.

In our fifth episode, Lee Hendricks, Fieldwork Education's International Curriculum Manager for the Middle Years, interviews educational expert Malcolm Nicolson to further explore the IMYC Process to Facilitate Learning, particularly with the mini-cycle of Research, Record, and Reflect that can be repeated several times to deepen knowledge, skills, and understanding. Malcolm talks about the importance of agency in the learning process, so students, according to him, feel that education is something done with them in mind rather than to them.

In this webinar, Jan explains why testing young children usually means that teachers capture information that does not give provide them with a true picture of the child’s learning and development. In response to this, Jan explains how schools should use observational strategies and techniques to construct their knowledge of their learners.

It's a great dish any time of year. Both my husband & son love's chicken curry as long it has enough potatoes but there's another vegetable that my husband loves with his chicken curry. It's this vegetable that makes his chicken curry taste so good/so sweet! That vegetable is ""Squash""! Not any squash but rather the squash from my backyard garden! That said, I'm pleased to share with you my chicken & squash curry, which I'm complementing it with my husband favorite side, ""Oil roti"". This chicken curry offers bold #Guyaneseflavors, which comes from all the herbs & spices that are perfectly infused into the masala, which the chicken & squash absorbs with ease. That's what you're tasting within the chicken along with slight peppery kick from the peach & wiri wiri peppers. The squash lends a hand to give the curry a taste of freshness and as the squash boils rapidly in the curry sauce/gravy, it becomes translucent and transcend into a silky texture. Oil Roti complements the chicken curry very well. Enjoy!

Honestly speaking, I don't cook King fish curry too often, however, that might change going forward after I'm done with this curry because it's out of this world. It's bursting with rich #Guyaneseflavors in rich based curry sauce that's tangy, sour and garlicky, while the king fish is very mild in flavor. It's a firm meaty fish yet flaky and while it stews in the curry sauce, it absorbs all the spices & herbs that are infused into the bunja curry. This King fish is an excellent dish for any fish lovers, which goes well with rice or any of your favorite rotis with my homemade pickled karela in vinegar. As for the fried barramundi, it's crispy on the outside, while the inside is juicy and flaky with its white delicate meat that offers a sweet and butter flavor. Make no mistake, this is NOT a fishy fish, which means, even kids love it due to its delicious flavor. Thanks, and enjoy.

You may not know this, but Rose of Sharon flowers are edible, and most people don't contemplate about eating flowers. There are quite a few flowers that are quite tasty and Rose of Sharon flowers are no differ. There's a slight nuttiness that comes through from the flowers along with real #Guyaneseflavors from the bara batter that surrounds the stuffed flower with the chicken. The chicken is well seasoned that offers good source of protein, while lending a hand for a nice chewy texture. To complement my stuffed Rose of Sharon, I'm pairing it with my Sweet Chili Mango Chutney that has a spicy kick from the chili pepper.

Maybe it's a good sign for him, for good things to come. This harvest from my humble garden was definitely a bountiful one with lots of peppers that look so pretty like a rose when bunched together. I was surprised with the number of tomatoes I picked and there were quite a few fatty ones but that wasn't the biggest surprise of the day! It was the gingee that I picked hiding under the baggie patch. It's truly a blessing such a large gingee at this stage of my garden. I wasn't surprised with the amount of squash I picked because they were already visually on the machan. With so much squash at hand, my mom and I cleaned, chipped and steamed them the follow day which will be for the upcoming winter. Marsa, purple leaf, chori baggie, bigan (eggplant), bora and karela rounded off the harvest and today (September 24, 2022), I'm uploading this video to show you all the fresh vegetables that this humble garden produced.

Some may say, karela is absolutely an acquired taste but it’s one of my favorite vegetable to cook. Today, I'm sharing with you my version of pickled karela in  lime juice mingling with onion, hot balafire peppers & crushed garlic. Also, on the same day, picked karela in vinegar with onion and hot balafire peppers, which is my dad's recipe. Despite being pickled, it's a like condiment which is delicious by itself or you can have it with any cooked vegetables or fish curry or fried or grilled fish. Both offers a nice soury taste with a slight bitterness and if eaten as an appetizer, you get a crisp freshness and a bit of a nutty undertone. Both the lime juice and vinegar takes over the pickling process in the jar with the bitterness being mellowed and become a bit less with sour notes. Thank you and enjoy!

The tomatoes are coming along nicely and the long purple & black beauty bigan are completing well with the squash. Cucumbers, seime and karela are starting to thrive, which I'm hoping to last throughout September. As for the Guyana bora, it's still going strong which is a surprise because it's producing way better than last year. My mom and dad are always with me in the garden and even though my dad supervise a lot, he still helps me pick the squash along with my mom. As for the wiri wiri peppers, they are being stubborn this year and are not feisty as last year but nevertheless, I'm hoping for the best.

Ten, eleven  spices & herbs are bunja in a masala mixture to give the duck curry such a bold and intense taste with #Guyaneseflavors that explodes in your mouth. The texture of the duck meat is soft and tender along with the chunks of potatoes being fork tender, while the curry sauce/gravy is like liquid gold with incredible and complex flavors that comes from the aromatic spices & herbs. This chatak duck curry is not science but rather a simple dish, which can be served with a wide variety of side dishes. Fortunately for me, rice is requested for the duck curry and nothing elaborate like dal puri. Either way, this chatak duck curry with chunks of aloo can be addicting whether it's with rice, roti, dal puri or even as a chaser but most importantly, don't for the pepper sauce.

As you all know, cook up rice is also known as all-in-one, which is a single concept surrounding a one pot dish and knowing how to toss whatever you may have to achieve a good looking dish with a unique taste. That being said, my cook up will be beaming with various provisions (ground/root vegetables) creating a mixture of different textures and taste. To add more depth and flavors to the dish, I'm infusing the cook up rice with smoked turkey to give the cook up a nice smoky flavor. The texture of the rice is wet and very moist coupled with the soft and flaky texture of the turkey along with the smokiness, which adds a unique taste to the rice. As for my spicy soya basil chicken, the flavors and taste are exactly as it's name and with first bite, you taste the basil and a hint of smokiness from the soya sauce. Then comes the spiciness from the wiri wiri peppers and surprisingly the sweetness from the caramelized onions. My homemade pepper sauce made with bellami or soury complements my smoky turkey cook up rice very well. Thank you and enjoy!

Nevertheless, the white shrimps still offers that perfect balance of taste, flavors and texture when compliment it with dal and rice. The chipped okra is constantly stirred and fry and cook down to an almost charred, while still keeping some of it's green color. The texture of the okra is soft with a slight but pleasant chew and a smoky char taste that no other vegetable can stand up to. The shrimps lends a hand to give you an elusive but delicate flavor, a subtle taste and a dainty texture. As for the second dish, it's my fried high water fish choka and it's been a long time since I've dine on this incredible fish choka. The high water fish are fried to perfection with aromatic herbs and spices along fragrant curry powder and masala. By hand, it's pulled apart, removing the bones and then roughly mashed to a choka consistency. To give the choka a kick, wiri wiri peppers are added along with lime juice to add some acidity to enhance and bring out the flavor of the high water fish. Dal and rice are side compliments which completes this meal very well whether it's for lunch or dinner. Thank you and enjoy!

In part 1 you saw me harvest chori & marsa bhaji and purple leaf callaloo. In part 2, I'm will be showing you how I prepare these amazing and tasty bhaji for the winter, which I do throughout the summer. My mom and dad will be helping me chipping and preparing the bhaji while I'm cooking and as you will see in the video, we work as a good team. Cooking and freezing bhaji is such a wonderful idea especially when you don't have to buy bhaji during the winter because we'll have enough to last until summer again. When you cook the bhaji in advance like this and store it in the freezer for the winter, it takes up less space. Also, when you're ready to cook the bhaji, it takes less time, whether it's vegetarian style or when adding Guyana black shrimps. You just fry the shrimps for a few minutes, add the bhaji and fry for another several minutes and it's done. Make no mistake though, it taste as fresh as the day you picked it.

Today, I'm pleased to share with you my take on a poor man's lobster curry, but make no mistake, it's not lobster but rather monkfish, which is also known as pacuma in Guyana. I’m a big fan of monkfish but not for it's looks but the taste. This monkfish curry is one of my all time favorite curry because it's a big meaty fish that works incredible well with warm,  aromatic spices and intense bunja masala mixture. You’ll love the meaty & firm texture and sweet subtle flavor of the monkfish, while the tamarind sour gives the curry a nice zing making the monkfish utterly delicious that will truly rock your world! You've got to try this poor man's lobster curry because it's better than what you'll find on most curry house menus. The taste is amazing and it delivers an entirely extraordinary curry. What else I could ever wish for? Thank you and enjoy!

However, rice is featured in the video for this pumpkin recipe. As for the seime & eddo curry with black tiger shrimps, it has a delicious earthy flavor which is released at the boiling point, which also brings out their intense flavor especially from the black shrimps.

These choka's are also two of the best Guyanese breakfast with intense flavors coming from the smoky sweetness from both the bigan and tomatoes. Both are caramelized in their own way while roasting on the fire and by adding wiri wiri peppers to the mix, it lends a hand to make the choka scream with a peppery kick. While the bigan choka offers a soft, silky and spongy texture, the tomato choka is more of a soft liquid texture from the tomato pulp with a slight crunch from the diced onion. All you need now is a couple of oil roti and a hot cup of coffee, or tea for a satisfying breakfast. Thank you and enjoy!

I call this taco weekend, which I had no idea that the wildlife would show up as special guests. Maybe through the vine grapevine, they heard that I was making hard and soft chicken tacos and to wash it all down, my refreshing lime wash or sugar water. They saw tenderized sliced chicken breast seasoned to perfection, which was seared and cooked on the griddle, while the ground chicken was cooked indoors. All the condiments made these taco incredibly good especially with the roasted peppers and cilantro sauce. I think the most anticipate guest was Mr. Bunny, which he waited throughout the course of making the tacos. At the end, he left empty handed but my family sure enjoyed these under the tent tacos and yes, we washed them down with my refreshing lime wash and so will you. Thank you and enjoy!

I'm Mark Scarbrough. And I've got a question. You want dinner? This is it. It takes mac-and-cheese to a new level. All in an Instant Pot.
This recipe is made for a 5- or 6-quart Instant Pot. Look down at the bottom of this recipe to discover how to change it for other pots.
First, turn the pot to SAUTE at medium or normal or custom 300F.
Then add 1 tablespoon/15 grams of butter, followed by 1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped.
Stir around for a minute or two, then crumble in 1 pound LEAN ground beef.
Stir until the meat loses its raw, red color. Then stir in 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon mild paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some grated or ground nutmeg (maybe 1/4 teaspoon grated and 1/8 teaspoon ground--or more if you like it as much as I do!).
Pour in 2 cups/470 ml chicken (or vegetable) broth. Stir well and heat until lots of steam is coming off the liquids.
Add 8 ounces/225 grams of raw, dried, medium pasta shells. Stir them gently in. Turn off the SAUTE function and set the pot to cook at HIGH pressure for 6 minutes. (If you've got a Max model--and ONLY if you've got a Max model--you can cook it at MAX for 5 minutes.)
Use a quick release to drop the pressure.
Set the SAUTE function back on.
Stir in 3/4 cup/180 ml heavy (or light) cream. Bubble the mixture for a minute or two, just until some of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir A LOT while this happens.
Turn off the SAUTE function and remove the (HOT!) insert from the pot. Sprinkle 5 ounces/140 grams of shredded sharp American-style cheddar over the casserole. Set the lid over the insert for 3 to 5 minutes, stir WELL, and serve it up!
For a 3-quart Instant Pot, you must halve all of the ingredient amounts except you must use 1 1/4 cups of broth.
For an 8-quart Instant Pot, you must increase ALL of the ingredient amounts by fifty percent.
And for a 10-quart Instant Pot, you must double ALL of the ingredient amounts.

Better yet, it's made with stuff right out of the freezer! Talk about hot-weather cooking. And talk about easy.
Join me, Mark Scarbrough, as I show you the steps to this recipe from our cookbook, FREEZER TO INSTANT POT. The cookbook is available here: https://amzn.to/2Nhiii7. But you can find the whole recipe right here!
1. Put a 5- or 6-quart Instant Pot on the high or more setting for the SAUTE button. Stir in 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups)/1.4 liters of vegetable or chicken broth, as well as 2 tablespoons/30 grams unsalted butter, 2 minced garlic cloves (about 2 teaspoons), 2 teaspoons of a dried spice or spice blend of your choice (I used dried rosemary), 1 teaspoon onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper.
2. Heat all of this until lots of steam rises from the liquids. Then stir in 1 pound/450 grams FROZEN UNSEASONED hash brown cubes (or small potato cubes) and 1 1/4 pounds/560 grams FROZEN tater tots or potato puffs.
3. Turn off the SAUTE setting and lock the lid onto the pot. Cook at HIGH pressure for 3 minutes, followed by a quick release.
4. Unlatch the lid and open the cooker. Sprinkle 8 ounces/225 shredded American-style sharp cheddar (or really any semi-firm cheese you like) over the soup. Put the lid back on and wait a couple of minutes to let the cheese melt.

Which means we love reuben sandwiches out of an air fryer because they get EXTRA crunchy.
You'll be surprised by our trick to getting the tastiest reuben.
Nope, not the cheese. Or the corned beef. It's the mayonnaise. Yep, mayo. Find out why in the video!


Here's the recipe:
Warm sliced corned beef (or even pastrami, if you want to get untraditional on us) at 400F/205C for a couple of minutes, just until warmed through.
Take 2 slices of rye bread and coat one side of each slice with a little mayonnaise. (Low-fat works fine, but fat-free? Not so good).
Set the slices mayo-side-down on a cutting board. Spread 2 or 3 teaspoons Russian dressing on each non-mayo-ed slice of bread. Top with sauerkraut which has been squeezed dry over the sink (otherwise, the sandwich will get soggy).
Top with the warmed corned beef and a couple of slices of Swiss cheese (unless you're like Mark and refuse cheese on the sandwich--because he's kosher?).
Close the sandwich, mayo-ed sides out.
Air-fry in a drawer model for about 8 minutes without turning, until browned and crisp. If you're using a drawer-style air fryer, you might consider turning the sandwich once halfway through, depending on how good the air circulation is in your model.
Cool a minute or two (unlike Bruce!) before slicing (diagonal? widthwise?) and enjoying!

Here's the biggest mistake people make: they overcrowd the machine.
You can't. You need to allow for air circulation. Air fryers work on heat circulation. Period. So you have to allow for it.

Skip those pictures with a zillion French fries in the basket. Or those videos where somebody pulls a hundred pounds of wings out of their air fryer. Impossible! They've cheated.

What's the best way to make chicken wings? No spray, no sauce. Just put the cut-apart chicken wings in the basket so they make one layer. Cook at 375F/190C and cook them for 25 minutes, tossing or stirring every five minutes to make sure every part of every wing gets hit with the hot air.

Hi, I'm Mark Scarbrough. And if you know our cooking channel, COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK, you know I've been on a Tex-Mex jag for a while now.
This video is my NEW take on a childhood favorite: tamale pie. It was cafeteria food when I was a kid. (Back when schools had real cafeterias!)
This tamale pie recipe is actually controversial! Some people put the cornbread on the top. I guess because they like crunchy cornbread. But if you follow my recommendations, you'll never have soggy cornbread.
Man, I ate a lot of this while I was recipe-testing. Don't look at my waistline. But it's so hearty, so good, so darn comforting that I'm not sorry I did.
Tamale pie casserole. What could be better?

Here's the recipe for my tamale pie casserole:
Start out by heating the oven to 350F/175C.
Next, generously butter the inside of a 9-inch/23-cm square baking pan.
Now make the cornbread. Mix all this together in a large bowl:
3/4 cup/140 grams yellow cornmeal
2/3 cup/125 grams all-purpose or plain flour
1 tablespoon/20 grams drained jarred diced pimientos
1 tablespoon/10 grams drained minced jarred pickled jalapeño rings
1 tablespoon/12 grams granulate white sugar (DON'T TELL MY TEXAS MOM!)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
and 1/4 teaspoon table salt.
Use a wooden spoon to mix these things into those dry ingredients:
3/4 cup/190 grams (easiest to weigh it, honestly, right in that large bowl) buttermilk
3 tablespoons/40 grams butter, melted and cooled
and 1 large egg.
Stir to form batter, then spread this mixture into the prepared pan. It's not a lot, so you'll have to use a rubber spatula to spread it out.
Bake until firm to the touch, 12 to 15 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack TO ROOM TEMPERATURE. Or better: OVERNIGHT. Or best: 24 hours!
Can you make this with Jiffy Cornbread mix? Yes, but use the flavoring enhancements I suggest. And make a half or two-thirds batch, given that you want enough space for what comes next to sit on top of the cornbread.

Now you're ready to make the tamale pie casserole.
Poke holes all over that cornbread, then paint the top of it with 1/2 cup/120 grams canned red enchilada sauce.
Then, in a medium skillet set over medium heat, melt
1 tablespoon/13 grams butter
Add 1 small, peeled, and chopped yellow or white onion and 2 peeled and minced garlic cloves.
Cook, stirring often, until BARELY softened, about 2 minutes.
Crumble in 1 pound/450 grams ground (or minced) beef.
Add 1 tablespoon chile powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, and 1 teaspoon dried oregano.
Cook, stirring occasionally, just until the ground beef loses its raw, red color.
Add one 14-ounce/400-gram can of diced tomatoes. Cook, stirring often, until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
Pour this mixture over the painted cornbread. Then over the casserole with 1 cup/130 grams of shredded American-style sharp cheddar cheese.
Cover and bake in that 350F/175C oven for 15 minutes. Cool uncovered on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
If you want, you can broil the top of the casserole to brown it (provided you've used a broiler-safe baking dish)--about 8 inches from a heated broiler for 1 to 2 minutes.
Serve it up with big spoons. YUM!","['tamale pie recipe', 'tex mex recipe', 'tex mex food', 'tex mex', 'tamale pie', 'tex mex casserole', 'mark scarbrough', 'cooking with bruce and mark', 'tamale pie with cornbread', 'tamale pie recipes', 'how to make tamale pie']"

With an air fryer, you can use potato chips to coat fish fillets and come out with some of the crunchiest, tastiest fish fillets you've had. You don't need the chips. Or the fries. Or the crisps. Because they're on the fish. How about a salad?
This is a great air fryer recipe that shows just what the machine can do. It's pretty easy--and even gluten-free, if you use certified g-free potato chips and my recommendation: potato starch.

Join me, Bruce Weinstein, as I show you my favorite way to may crispy fish fillets in an air fryer.

Here are the ingredients:
1 cup/75 grams potato starch, poured onto a large serving plate or a pie plate
2 large eggs white, beaten until foamy in a medium bowl
8 ounces/225 grams potato chips, crushed to crumbs, poured onto a large serving plate or a pie plate
Four 4-ounce THAWED cod fillets

Heat the air fryer to 400F/205C.
Dip a fillet in the egg whites, coating it thoroughly on all sides. Then roll and coat it in the potato starch. Finally, lay it in the potato chip crumbs and generously coat it on all sides.
Set aside. DO NOT SPRAY WITH NONSTICK SPRAY.
When the air fryer is ready, set the fish in the drawer or on the racks with space between the fillets and air fry WITHOUT TURNING until golden brown, about 11 minutes.
Cool a couple of minutes before serving.

Hey, I'm Mark Scarbrough, half of the cookbook-writing team (with Bruce Weinstein) that's produced three (and more coming!) Instant Pot books. In this episode of COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK, I'm still on a Tex-Mex jag, trying to rediscover recipe that remind me of my childhood.

This recipe is basically a deeply flavored beef stew that tastes like the filling for enchiladas. It's not perfectly carb-free (there's brown sugar in it), but it does omit the tortillas for a lower-carb take on a classic Tex-Mex dish. Plus, it's economical and darn tasty.

Hey, let me know what you think!

Here's the recipe:

Mix all this in a large bowl until uniform:
1 tablespoon/15 grams dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon mild smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Add
2 pounds/1 kilo beef cube steak (that is, round steak or even eye of round that has been pierced repeatedly with either a commercial roller or a meat mallet's pointy side at home), cut into 3/4-inch strips. Toss well to coat evenly in the spice mixture.

In a 5- or 6-quart Instant Pot, stir together
1 cup/275 canned CRUSHED tomatoes (not diced or stewed or tomato sauce)
1/2 cup/120 ml DARK beer, preferably a brown ale (you can substitute unsweetened apple juice)
2 tablespoons/30 ml lime juice
1 tablespoon/8 grams standard chili powder

Stir well, then add the meat and any remaining spices in the bowl. Stir very gently.

Lock the lid onto the pot and cook on LOW pressure for 10 minutes, followed by a quick release.

Unlatch the lid and open the cooker. Sprinkle 6 ounces/170 grams shredded cheese on top, either a purchased Tex-Mex blend (without any added spices) or a combo of shredded Monterey Jack and American sharp cheddar. Set the lid askew over the pot and wait 5 minutes for the cheese to melt. Then dish it up!

If you want to make this stew in an 8-quart Instant Pot, you can either complete the recipe as stated except you must add 1/2 cup/120 ml of beef or chicken broth--or increase ALL of the ingredient amounts by fifty percent (without adding any additional broth).

If you want to make this stew in a 3-quart Instant Pot, halve almost all of the ingredient amounts EXCEPT keep the amount of beer the same (1/2 cup or 120 ml).

At El Fenix, to be even exacter.
Now I live in New England. And there's no Tex-Mex food to be had unless I make it. That's why I'm on a quest to rediscover the recipes from my childhood. Hey, I'm old. I get to do stuff like this. But come along with me anyway. Over the last few weeks, I've tried to create the best taco meat I could, the sort that reminds me of what I had in childhood.
My version of taco meat is hot. Very. Don't fool around with this stuff. It'll open up your sinuses. But it's worth it. It makes the best tacos, soft or hard-fried. Just remember: the burn doesn't quit with beer or iced tea. Fat kills the capsaicin, the chemical that makes your tongue hurt. So load up those tacos with real sour cream and shredded cheese. You have to!
Hey, what do you think? LMK!

Here's the recipe (with some additional notes):
First, warm 1 tablespoon/15 ml vegetable oil (or corn, safflower, canola, whatever--a neutral-flavored oil) in a medium skillet set over medium heat.
Add 1 chopped medium yellow or white onion (8 ounces or 225 grams)--then 3 peeled and minced medium garlic cloves (1 tablespoon), and 1 stemmed (seeded?) and finely chopped medium jalapeño chili. Stir for just 1 minute, just until the edges of the onion bits turn translucent, not until they soften.
Crumble in 1 pound/475 grams LEAN ground beef (or minced beef, if you're across the pond). Stir until lightly BUT EVENLY browned.
Now add the following: 3 tablespoons/40 grams tomato paste, the juice of half of a navel orange (about 3 tablespoons), 1 tablespoon chipotle chile powder (see below), 2 teaspoons dried oregano, 2 teaspoons table salt, and 1 teaspoon ground cumin.
Cook, stirring almost constantly, until the meat is cooked through, adding chicken, vegetable, or beef broth whenever the skillet dries out (you'll need about 1/2 cup/125 ml of broth total). It should take 2 or 3 minutes for the meat to get cooked through and the tomato paste dissolved throughout.
Now you're ready for tacos!

Okay, more about the chile powder, aka the heat. Chipotle chile powder is made from smoked jalapeños. It's SUPER hot. But it also adds a NECESSARY smoky component. If you don't want the taco meat to be quite so hot, substitute mild smoked paprika for the chipotle chile powder. Or use a half-and-half ratio of pure chipotle chile powder and mild smoked paprika. Always remember: there's a fresh jalapeño in the mix, too. So this version of taco meat will still be spicy, no matter what. I just like ALL the spicy things.

What do you think? Let me know? Would you make additions? I'd love to hear about them. The navel orange is my BIG controversial thing here. Well, and the tomato paste. But tomato paste is all over the Tex-Mex food I grew up with. Anyway, I love the sweet edge that the orange juice gives to the final dish. Agree?

Because we're using an air fryer, they're not like deep-fried treats. They're like a cross between a very sweet biscuit and a traditional cake doughnut/donut hole. They're great with a cup of tea or coffee in the afternoon.
This is a recipe from Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough's THE ESSENTIAL AIR FRYER COOKBOOK.

Here are the ingredients and the method (with some extra notes).
1.
Mix these in a large bowl until smooth:
1/2 cup/125 grams sour cream (use regular sour cream, not low-fat or fat-free, both of which have stabilizers that can break in the intense heat of an air fryer)
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated white sugar
2 tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled (make sure it's cooled down so it doesn't cook the egg)
1 large egg
And 1 teaspoon/5 ml vanilla extract.

2.
Add . . .
2 1/4 cups/325 grams all-purpose or plain flour
1 teaspoon/4 grams baking powder
And 1/2 teaspoon/2 grams table salt.

3.
Stir into a soft dough, then scoop this up in 2-tablespoon increments to create 18 donut (doughnut??) holes. Bruce uses a 2-tablespoon ice-cream scoop, which makes this recipe even easier. If you roll the balls by hands, lightly flour your hands to keep them from sticking but try to get as little extra flour into the balls as possible.

4.
Heat a large air fryer to 350F/175C. Notice that our recipes ask you to heat the air fryer before you add anything to it.

5. Spray or coat the balls with cooking spray or vegetable oil. Then set them in the air fryer. If your air fryer is not as big as ours, you may have to work in batches. No worries--just cover the extra balls with a clean kitchen towel so they don't dry out while the first batch cooks.
Air-fry for 12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into one of the doughtnut/donut holes (man, this drives me nuts!) comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack. (Bruce uses his clean hands.

But sometimes, you can only a piece of dinner. Where's the side dish?
Join me, Mark Scarbrough, as I show you how to make a teriyaki pork tenderloin in the Instant Pot, as well as the rice that goes along with it.

This is a recipe from our latest cookbook: INSTANT POT BIBLE: THE NEXT GENERATION.

Here's the recipe with some notes.

Put all of this in a 5- or 6-quart Instant Pot:
1/2 cup/120 ml soy sauce
1/2 cup/120 ml unsweetened apple juice
2 tablespoons/40 grams honey
1 medium garlic clove, peeled and minced (about 1 teaspoon)
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
2 medium scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced.

Stir well, then add 1 1/2 pounds/700 grams pork tenderloin, halved widthwise, to this sauce.

Set a 1-quart/1-liter, 6-inch-across/15-cm-across, high-sided, pressure-and-food-safe baking dish on top of the tenderloins. Add to it
1 cup/180 grams raw long-grain white rice (don't get fancy)
1 1/2 cups/575 ml water (you can add vegetable broth for more heft)
1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground dried ginger
1/2 teaspoon table salt.
Do not cover. Stir well and lock the lid onto the pot.

4 minutes at HIGH pressure (in an INSTANT POT only--if you're working with any other electric pressure cooker, you'll need to go for 5 to 6 minutes at high), followed by 10 minutes at natural release, then a quick release to get rid of any residual steam in the pot.

That's it. Serve it up. Remember that the baking dish is super hot. Use hot pads or silicone baking mitts to get it out of the pot. Carve the tenderloin into medallions. You can boil down the sauce in the pot with the sauté setting for a bit, or you can just serve the sauce as it is (as I did).","['pork tenderloin recipes', 'pork tenderloin instant pot', 'pork tenderloin', 'instant pot recipes', 'instant pot pork tenderloin', 'mark scarbrough', 'cooking with bruce and mark', 'instant pot bible', 'pork', 'pork loin recipes']"

Sure, we've all had it out of the bottle. But honestly, Bruce Weinstein and I love this homemade version more than we can say. (We've even poured it over cooked white rice alongside pork chops off the grill!)

This recipe is so simple. And what you make will keep in a jar in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Or no, it won't. You'll eat it. Promise.

By the way, store it in a glass jar. Or a nonreactive jar. Don't put this sauce in almost any metal container or pottery. All sorts of bad stuff can leach out of the finishes because of the acidity of the sauce. 

Here's the recipe:
Bring all this to a simmer in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat:
1/2 cup/125 ml unseasoned (!) rice vinegar
1/2 cup/125 ml water
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated white sugar
1 tablespoon/15 ml dry vermouth
1 tablespoon/15 ml soy sauce
1 tablespoon/10 grams minced peeled garlic (about 3 medium cloves)
And 1 tablespoon/7 grams minced peeled fresh ginger.

Stir until the sugar dissolves, bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute.
Then stir in:
2 - 3 tablespoons/30 - 45 grams sambal oelek (a fiery, vinegary Indonesian condiment)
2 - 3 teaspoons/12 - 18 grams red pepper flakes

Boil about 2 minutes to blend the flavors.
Whisk together:
1 tablespoon/15 ml water
1 tablespoon/8 grams cornstarch or corn flour
Whisk this slurry into the simmering chili mixture. Continue cooking until thickened, about 1 minute. Take the mixture immediately off the heat.
If you want, you can now stir in a few drops of red food coloring. I'd rather not. But go ahead, if you prefer.
That's it. Cool it a bit, then store it, covered, in the fridge in a glass container for up to 3 weeks, maybe even 1 month.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter on the sauté function in a 5-, 6-, or 8-quart Instant Pot.

Stir in 3 cups chopped baby spinach leaves (about 3 ounces), then pour in 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth. (You can use chicken broth for a richer dish--and if you don't need it to be vegetarian.)
Stir in 12 ounces dried medium shell pasta (for the exact shape, check the video).

Too gross in a skillet but just right in an air fryer!
Check out this deep dive into a recipe. Join Bruce Weinstein as he takes you through the steps to make some of the tastiest fried chicken you've ever had in an air fryer. It's tender, juicy, and utterly irresistible.
Also, porky.
How could be it be bad?

This is a recipe from our book THE ESSENTIAL AIR FRYER COOKBOOK.
Did you know this is the only air-fryer cookbook written so that every recipe is sized out for (almost) every size of air fryer? Okay, no 1-quart minis and no 12-quart behemoths. But we've got everything else covered. AND it's not just a matter of simple math. It's a matter of getting the ratios right. Check it out!

In the meantime, here are the ingredients and steps (with some further explanations).
Grind all of this in a food processor:
3 ounces/85 grams fried pork rinds or chicharrones
3 tablespoons/15 grams plain panko breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground dried cayenne
Pour the coating into a shallow pie plate or a soup bowl.
Put 2 large egg whites and 3 tablespoons/45 grams water in a second shallow pie plate or soup bowl. Whisk until combined.
 Use these two mixtures to coat boneless skinless chicken thighs. The recipe says it will make four 6-ounce/170 gram thighs. It may make a couple more--but the point is to have more coating than you need because it gets wet and starts to clump after repeated dipping.
Egg-white mixture first, then pork-rind mixture. Coat well but not thick. Watch how thick it is in the video!
Heat the air fryer to 375F/190C (or 200C, if that's the only option)

Pro tip! Let that air fryer heat up before you add the food. Cool coatings in a cool air fryer just blow around. A hot air fryer will almost instantly set a coating.

Air-fry for about 14 minutes, until the coating is well browned and fully set.
They'll need salt when they come out of the air fryer. Okay, maybe not as much as Bruce uses. But still . . . salt.","['air fried chicken', 'pork rind chicken', 'fried chicken recipe', 'cooking with bruce and mark', 'essential air fryer', 'how to air fry chicken']"

Put all of these things in a 5-, 6-, or 8-quart Instant Pot with the SAUTÉ setting turned to medium:
2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce (since there's no reduction in the pot, a reduced-sodium soy sauce really tastes best)
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons thick red chile sauce, such as sambal oelek (you can use less, of course)
2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar (that is, rice vinegar with no added sugar)
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger (of course purchased minced ginger in a bottle is fine!)
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 cup peanut butter, preferably a no-salt, natural-style, creamy peanut butter
Stir well and heat until mixture bubbles. It's really important that the liquids start to bubble (not boil). The hotter the liquids, the faster the pot will come to pressure. Which means the spaghetti won't stick and burn to the bottom of the insert.
Lay 8 ounces dried spaghetti on top in a cross-hatch pattern. (You may need to break the dried spaghetti in half, depending on the size of your insert.) 
Turn off the SAUTÉ function. Then set for 6 minutes at high pressure, followed by a quick release.

Once hot, put some solid fat in the skillet. Bruce used butter. Consider shortening, coconut oil, lard, schmaltz, goose fat, duck fat. Go for it.

2/3 cup/140 grams granulated white sugar
2/3 cup/160 ml lemon juice (fresh is best--but bottled will work)
Zest of 2 lemons, finely grated or grated and then VERY finely minced
2 large eggs
Microwave on high in 30-second increments for 3 minutes (6 increments), letting it go the full time for the first three times, then whisking every time it mounds in the container thereafter, keeping the timing pretty sacrosanct, until the mixture can coat the back of a wooden spoon or until its internal temperature reaches 175F/80C.
This recipe is made for a 900- to 1000-watt microwave. If yours is more powerful, you'll have to work in 20-second increments and perhaps do fewer of them. If yours is less powerful, you'll need to work in seven or more 30-second increments.

These are savory waffles you could serve up with drinks (try them with mustard and smoked salmon! or tapenade!) or as the base for beef stew or as a crunchy side dish alongside just about any roast or grilled protein. They're even great as a bed for grilled vegetables.

Here's the recipe:
3 cups/12 ounces/340 grams riced cauliflower
2 cups/240 grams seasoned panko breadcrumbs (you can use gluten-free seasoned panko breadcrumbs)
1 cup/57 grams shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano (don't skimp and use the fake stuff in the can)
4 large eggs
To make the waffles:
Great and heat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Use about 1/2 cup cauliflower mixture per waffle--and let them go much longer than you would a traditional breakfast or dessert waffle, maybe up to 2 full cycles, until browned and crunchy.","['savory waffles', 'waffle recipe', 'cauliflower waffles', 'cauliflower waffle recipe', 'cauliflower waffle', 'savory waffle recipe', 'kitchen shortcut bible', 'cooking with bruce and mark', 'bruce weinstein', 'mark scarbrough']"

Gingersnaps shouldn't be soft. They should be dipping cookies (in coffee, in tea, in wine). Here's the way to make them crisp and irresistible.
And spicy! Gingersnaps should be loaded with ginger. Get the know-how to make the best gingersnap cookies in this episode of COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK.
Here are the ingredients and directions (with some additional notes):
1 1/2 cups/300 grams granulated white sugar
1/2 cup/100 grams chopped crystallized or candied ginger
Grind these into a fine powder in a high-powdered blender or food processor.
12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)/170 grams UNSALTED butter
6 tablespoons/150 grams solid vegetable shortening
Blend (or ""cream"") these with the ground sugar/ginger mixture in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed.
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons/40 grams black treacle or molasses
Beat the eggs into the mixture one at a time. Then beat in the treacle or molasses.
3 cups/385 grams all-purpose or plain flour
2 teaspoons/14 grams ground dried ginger
2 teaspoons/14 grams baking soda
1 teaspoon/3 grams table salt
Mix the dry ingredients together, then beat them into the batter at low speed until well combined.
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
1 tablespoon/21 grams ground cinnamon
Mix these two ingredients in a separate bowl.
Use a scant 2 tablespoons (or 1 1/2 tablespoons) of dough to make a small ball, roll it in the cinnamon sugar, and set it on a lined baking sheet. Continue making more cookies, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake in batches at 350F/175C for 15 minutes or until crisp. Cool on a wire rack for at least a few minutes or until room temperature.
Makes about 3 dozen cookies

And rich! And delicious! This cream of asparagus soup from an Instant Pot fits the bill.
This recipe is a sneak first look at one from our brand-new book INSTANT POT BIBLE: THE NEXT GENERATION.
Bruce is here to give you the details. It's a pretty easy soup: all PIP (pot-in-pot), made in an Instant Pot, a great starter for any meal or an ultra rich dinner when you want to treat yourself right.
An Instant Pot makes meals like this so easy. This electric pressure cooker can turn out the creamiest soup--if you work under certain conditions. Let Bruce Weinstein show you how!

Here are the ingredients and method (as well as some more information):
Whisk all of this in a 2-quart/2-liter high-sided baking dish, such as a soufflé dish, until the flour dissolves:
1 cup/240 ml chicken or vegetable broth (if you use vegetable broth, the dish is vegetarian)
1 cup/240 ml whole milk
1 cup/240 ml heavy cream (use single cream in the UK--and add a splash of double cream, if you want)
2 tablespoons minced chives (or the green part of a scallion or spring onion)
1/2 teaspoon celery seeds
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (fresh, please!)
1/4 cup/32 grams all-purpose or plain flour
Stir in 12 ounces/340 grams pencil-thin asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into small bits
Put 1 1/2 cups/350 ml water in a 6- or 8-cup Instant Pot (or 2 cups/480 ml water in a 10-quart Instant Pot).
Set a rack in the pot; set the filled baking dish on top (uncovered).
Cook at high pressure (NOT max) for 30 minutes, followed by a quick release. (Some soup will come up out of the baking dish--don't worry--it'll be no more than drips--but it's important that you don't cover the soup so that it gets an even, steady pressure.)
Release the pressure, unlock the pot, remove the lid, and whisk the soup until smooth. (Or puree or blend, as desired.)

Join Mark Scarbrough as he takes this deep dig into the eggnog he makes every year. Why now? Because this stuff has to ripen. It needs a good month in your fridge. Then it needs a long night in front of a fire.

Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough have published thirty-six cookbooks, with more on the way (and not including those ghosted for celebs).

We want a hearty bowlful of grain goodness: oats, maybe more, as well as wheat germ, nuts, and real sweeteners, nothing fake.

Join Bruce Weinstein on this deep dig episode of COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK as he shows you his signature granola recipe. It's essentially a road map recipe so that you customize it to your heart's content. Just add milk. Maybe berries. Or yogurt. (Mark says half-and-half but he spends forty minutes a day on a cross-trainer.)

This is a recipe from our 900-recipe tome, THE ULTIMATE COOK BOOK.

Here are the ingredients and the method (with some notes):
6 cups/540 grams rolled grains--choose from standard rolled oats (not quick-cooking, steel-cut, or medium-ground oats) plus possibly barley flakes, wheat flakes, and/or kamut flakes. (Kamut is an ancient strain of wheat; both kamut and barley flakes will make a MUCH more savory granola. You can, of course, use 100% standard rolled oats.)
Spread these on one or two baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes at 325F/160C/Gas mark 4 or until lightly toasted. Cool for a few minutes (maintain the oven's temperature).

1 cup/150 grams chopped nuts (choose pecans, almonds, walnuts, and/or skinned hazelnuts)--or substitute an equal VOLUME for all or just part of the nuts with shredded unsweetened coconut and/or unsalted seeds. (This is the point you can even add some chia seeds.)
1/2 cup/42 grams wheat germ
1/2 cup/36 grams powdered nonfat dried milk (optional--but it does add a lot of body to the granola)
6 tablespoons/75 grams dark or light brown sugar (or another sort of molasses-rich sugar like muscovado or turbinado--the grains of demerara sugar tend to be too large.)
1 1/2 teaspoons/10 grams ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons10 grams table salt
Mix all these WITH THE TOASTED GRAINS in a large bowl.

2/3 cup/160 ml oil (choose among any nut oil like walnut or pecan and/or a neutral-flavored oil like canola or vegetable oil--avoid olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil which gives the granola an overpowering, unpleasant flavor)
2/3 cup/160 liquid sweetener (choose among maple syrup, sorghum syrup, agave syrup, honey, and/or Lyle's Golden Syrup--avoid molasses or treacle)
1 tablespoon/15 ml vanilla extract
Mix these in a small saucepan and warm over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid sweetener is smooth in the mix. Do not simmer or boil. Pour over the grain mixture and stir until well combined.

Spread the grain and sweetener mixture on one or two baking trays. Bake at 325F/160C/Gas mark 4 for 10 minutes. Stir the grains and swap the trays around in the oven. Continue baking for 10 more minutes or until lightly toasted. Cool on a wire rack on the baking sheets until room temperature.

If desired, you can stir 1/2 cup/80 grams chopped dried fruit (raisins, dried blueberries, dried cranberries, sultanas, dried currants, or other dried fruit) into the granola just after it comes out of the oven.

For cheesecake? Yep, an instant pot makes the creamiest cheesecake imaginable. If you doubt us, you just haven't made one yet.

Join Bruce Weinstein in this episode of the ""Deep Dig"" series on our channel COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK as he shows you some of the tricks and techniques of making cheesecake in an Instant Pot, an electric pressure cooker.

One note: a pressure-cooker cheesecake is not dense and chewy. It has a mousse-like texture, actually light but very creamy (because of the way pressure gets into and ""leavens"" the batter). You'll need a 7-inch/18-cm round springform pan, a food processor (a must!), and a few simple ingredients.

This is a recipe from our newest book, out this November: INSTANT POT BIBLE--THE NEXT GENERATION.

Here they are:
1 pound/450 grams regular cream cheese (at room temperature--do not use low-fat or fat-free)
2/3 cup/175 grams smooth peanut butter (preferably natural style)
1/2 cup/120 ml heavy cream
1/3 cup/70 grams granulated white sugar
1/3 cup/70 grams packed dark brown sugar
2/3 cup/175 grams smooth peanut butter (preferably natural style)
2 whole eggs, at room temperature
2 tablespoons/16 grams all-purpose or plain flour
2 teaspoons/10 ml vanilla extract

Put all these things in a food processor and whir them up until smooth.

10 standard Oreo or chocolate-cream sandwich cookies, ground to crumbs
Baking spray (a spray of flour and oil)

Spray the inside of a 7-inch/18-cm round springform pan with baking spray. Then pour in the crumbs and make an even crust about halfway up the sides of the pan. Fill the pan evenly with the cream cheese batter. Do not cover.

Put 1 1/2 cups/375 ml water and a rack in a 6- or 8-quart Instant Pot.

25 minutes at high pressure (do not use max, if you have a max machine), followed by a natural release.

After cooling and unmolding, dust the top of the cheesecake with a mixture of 2 teaspoons/15 grams unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 teaspoons/15 grams confectioners' or icing sugar.

That's what Mark Scarbrough ate at family reunions when he was comin' up in the South. Join him as he takes a deep dig into this classic cake. He even renovates the recipe a bit to make it (a little) less sweet but even more irresistible in this deep dig episode of the channel COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK


For those who don't know (his husband Bruce Weinstein, Yankees, Europeans, just about every one else in the world), Coca-Cola cake is a Southern American classic: a chocolate cake with marshmallows, pecans (say it right: puh-KAHNS), and lots of Coke. There are many copycat and rip-off recipes out there. Mark will explain what's WRONG with most of them. And he's morphed the classic into a new take on this sheet cake that'll set you back a bit (brace yourself) and needs vanilla ice cream to ""cut the sweet.""


Here are the cake ingredients (with some notes):
2 cups/340 grams all-purpose or plain flour
1 1/4 cups/275 grams granulated white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons/8 grams baking soda
1/2 teaspoon/3 grams table salt
1 cup/230 grams unsalted butter (if you use salted butter, nix the salt above), melted and cooled for 5 minutes
6 tablespoons/35 grams unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons/10 ml vanilla extract (who measures this?)
1 cup/240 ml carbonated cola (do not use diet or reduced-sugar varieties)
1/2 cup/120 ml buttermilk, preferably uncultured
2 large eggs, at room temperature


Rack in center and oven at 350F/175C/Gas mark 4. Grease or butter and flour a 9 x 13-inch/23 x 33 cm baking pan (do NOT use glass)
Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl until uniform.
Whisk the melted butter, cocoa powder, and vanilla in a small bowl or the small saucepan with the melted butter until well combined.
Whisk the cola, buttermilk, and eggs in a third (!) but big (!!) bowl until uniform.
Whisk the butter mixture into the cola mixture. Then whisk in the flour mixture JUST UNTIL MOISTENED if still grainy.
Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack to room temperature, about 1 1/2 hours.


For the icing:
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick)/58 grams unsalted butter
2 ounces/55 grams unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup/60 ml carbonated cola (again, no diet or reduced-sugar stuff)
2 cups/110 grams mini marshmallows
1 teaspoon/5 ml vanilla extract
2 cups/365 grams confectioners', powdered, or icing sugar
1 cup/125 grams pecan pieces, chopped


Melt the butter and chocolate about halfway in a medium saucepan set over LOW heat. Whisk in the cola, half the marshmallows (guess!), and the vanilla. Continue whisking until almost all the marshmallows have melted, then take the pan off the heat and continue whisking until fully melted.
Whisk in enough of the confectioners' sugar until the mixture forms a spreadable icing.
Stir in the remainder of the mini marshmallows and pecans.
Spread the icing over the cooled cake.
Eat it right out of the pan. Mark did.

UCEHB7jMymvg63b6x30qx5Jw,How to Make Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies,How to Make Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies,sDfW7T1jSOY,2020-09-24T14:00:09Z,75,False,3,2,9:48,"Cookies! Vegan! Chocolate chip! How is that possible? In this deep dig episode in the series on COOKING WITH BRUCE AND MARK, Bruce Weinstein takes on the problem of getting a crisp vegan cookie--and solves it with a mix of oats, maple syrup, and--yes!--tahini, a sesame seed paste, familiar from Middle Eastern cooking.


Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough are the authors of thirty-five cookbooks (with more in the works). In their deep dig series, they take on wonky, delicious, quirky, or just plain astounding recipes, explaining the ends and outs of how they work.


Here's the story: on book tours, Bruce and Mark used to stop at Whole Foods to pick up car grub. Inevitably, they'd buy some chocolate chip cookies. Inevitably, those cookies would be--gross--soft and spongy. Mark asked Bruce if he could figure out a way to make a crisp vegan cookie. And voilà! This vegan cookie recipe.


Here are the ingredients (with a few notes):
3/4 cup/170 grams solid coconut oil
1 c up/210 grams granulated white sugar
1/2 cup/150 grams tahini (a sesame-seed paste--store extra, covered, in the fridge or freezer)
1/2 cup/120 ml maple syrup (preferably a dark amber--and don't you dare use artificial pancake syrup!)
1 1/2 tablespoons/25 ml vanilla extract (lots--more is better--Mexican vanilla, believe it or not, is even better)

1/2 cup 2 cups/300 grams all-purpose or plain flour (weigh all the things, please, please, please)
1 cup/100 grams standard rolled oats (do not use steel-cut, medium-grind, or quick-cooking oats)
1 teaspoon/7 grams baking soda
1 teaspoon/5 grams table salt (you can even up this a bit--these cookies are better if they're a little salty!)
3 cups/580 grams semi-sweet or bittersweet mini chocolate chips (the tiny ones give you more chocolate per bite because they spread out better in the batter)


Position the rack in the center of the oven. Heat the oven to 350F/175C/Gas mark 4



Beat the coconut oil and sugar in an electric mixer at medium speed until blended. Add the tahini and beat until smooth (seriously--airy and smooth). Add the maple syrup and vanilla; beat until well combined.


Beat in the baking soda and salt--then add the flour and oats. Mix on low just until combined if still grainy (just no dry specks of flour). Add the mini chocolate chips and mix on low just until evenly combined.


Roll into 2-tablespoon balls and set on a lined baking sheet (about 2 inches apart). Flatten the balls slightly.


Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until firm and lightly browned. Cool for a couple of minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Store in a covered container at room temperature for up to 4 days or in the freezer indefinitely.

I love these shish kebabs. If you keep your meat small and your veggies large you can cook them all at the same time. This way the meat is still juicy and tender and the veggies still have a nice crisp.  I did forget to add a little bit of salt and pepper to the veggies but its not that big of a deal. We are reheating the extra ones for lunch today. I love leftovers. God bless to you all. Dont forget to comment about the divided plates.

Its always nice to freeze your steak for 15 min before you cut it. This will help you make thinner cuts. If you love onions and peppers as much as we do use more, make it your own. If you have a taco seasoning you love you can use that,  I have never found one I love. If you have any I should try please send me a message. I hope you enjoy this as much as we do. God bless

Nutrition Information: This is a high potassium and higher protein dish. The potassium comes from the combination of the arugula, the white beans, the salmon and the dill. To lower the salmon, leave off the arugula and white beans, and instead substitute sliced cabbage or iceberg lettuce. You can also use smaller salmon fillets.

***Roasted Tomato soup with Artichoke & Spinach Grilled Cheese Recipe***
For 2 People

Ingredients:
For the Soup:
1 bulb of garlic
1.5 lbs tomatoes (about 5 medium sized tomatoes)
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into large pieces
1 onion, chopped
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup fresh basil

For the Grilled Cheese:
2 cups raw spinach, chopped
¾ cup ricotta
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
Salt and pepper
7 small artichoke heart, chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
4 slices sourdough bread or lower sodium, whole grain bread

Directions:
For the Soup
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
2. Slice about ½ inch off of the top of the bulb of garlic - just enough to expose the cloves.
3. Place the tomatoes, bell pepper, & onion in a baking dish. Drizzle 1/2 tbsp of olive oil over the vegetables along with a small pinch of salt. Mix together with your hands.
4. Pour the rest (1/2 tbsp) of olive oil on top of the head of garlic & enclose it in aluminum foil.
5. Place on the plate with the vegetables. Bake in a preheated oven at 350ºF for 45 minutes.
6. Once cooked, place the tomatoes, peppers and onions in a blender. Squeeze the bulb of garlic to remove the cloves & add the cloves to the blender along with 1/2 cup of water and the fresh basil. Blend well. If the mixture does not become completely blended together, don’t worry because it will all be pressed through a sieve.
7. Take a saucepan & place a sieve or mesh strainer over the top. Pour the tomato soup onto the strainer & crush the mixture with a spatula to let as much of the soup as possible pass through.  
8. Heat the soup over low heat

To Prepare the grilled cheese.
1. Heat a medium sized non-stick sauté pan over medium heat. Add the spinach & cook for 3-5 minutes or until cooked through.
2. Place the cooked spinach, ricotta, shredded mozzarella & artichoke hearts in a bowl and mix well. Season with salt & pepper if desired.
3. Cut 4 slices of bread & brush one side with olive oil. Turnover and add a little of the spinach-artichoke mix. Close, making sure the olive oil sides are on the outside.
4. Heat a skillet over medium heat and place the grilled cheese. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side until the bread is crispy & the inside is warm and melted.
5. Pour the tomato soup into two bowls & top with a drizzle of olive & some fresh basil. Serve the grilled cheese on the side.

***This is a high potassium dish because, well, it’s tomato soup. There’s not a lot of way around it. One way to possibly lower the potassium is by changing the serving size to 8 ounces. Another possibility is to use only 1 lbs of tomatoes and add 1/2 cup or so of vegetable broth to the soup instead.

Or maybe you have Stage 3 kidney disease and wonder if you will deal with kidney failure or transplant?

Being diagnosed with kidney disease is certainly an overwhelming experience for everyone, especially those people who have never seen a kidney doctor (Nephrologist) before. I see patients all the time who are diagnosed with kidney disease from their primary care physician and are then sent to me with very little information. 

More than 1 in 7 adults in America have chronic kidney disease. 37 million people in the US are estimated to have CKD (chronic kidney disease) and as many as 9 in 10 adults with CKD do not know they have CKD. 2 in 5 adults with severe CKD do not know they have CKD. 

When these patients do learn of their diagnosis, it is very natural to wonder what the future of their kidney disease holds. Watch this video to hear my thoughts on these questions.

This recipe will help #ChangeYourBuds as it is made with actual pumpkin puree and all the spices of fall you are craving. A full serving is only 14 grams of sugar and 69 mg of sodium. You can even add a little black coffee to this to give it a little extra kick in the morning.

This low-calorie, low-sodium smoothie is also a great source of fiber, potassium, and plant based protein. It’s helpful to layer smoothie ingredients in a certain order for the best texture. Always start with liquids first to create a vortex in the blender that pulls in other ingredients to be blended. Follow liquids with softer, high-moisture foods such as fresh fruits, softer vegetables, nut butters, or yogurt. Next, add hearty vegetables, such as carrots or kale, nuts, and seeds. Finish with frozen fruit or ice so the weight pushes the other ingredients down toward the vortex.

🌟 NOTE: This is a high-potassium smoothie.

INGREDIENTS:

1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for garnish
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 large pitted dates
2 tablespoons raisins

With this video I want to point out some easy ways that you can make delicious food at home to avoid buying those overly processed and salty grocery store items. I'll be sharing some quick recipes for things such as homemade pesto, no sodium all-purpose seasoning and more.

One of the absolute best days for me as a kidney doctor is when one of my patients receives a kidney transplant. It takes their kidney function from abnormal to good, takes them off dialysis and just generally makes them feel all around better. But in doing a deep dive in research on what to eat after a transplant and other methods to help protect that new organ - I was disappointed to see that there really isn't that much information out there. So I wanted to share this video with you all, whether you have had a transplant, are on the waiting list or just generally wanted to do some research on your own.

The goal with anyone with chronic kidney disease is to improve or maintain kidney function. That is measured from Creatinine levels or Glomerular Filtration Rate (aka GFR) in a routine blood test. With kidney disease the goal is to keep creatinine lower, which means the kidneys are filtering better, and their GFR higher.

In this week's video we are going to talk about if there is any food, drink or trick you can do to help lower your creatinine. You may have heard that red pepper, cabbage, berries or even nettle tea can help do this. Or maybe you have heard eating lots of red meat can help do this. We are going to discuss all this and more.

Zucchini “noodles” (also known as “zoodles”) combined with whole-wheat spaghetti creates a healthy ratio of vegetables to pasta. 

Roasting caramelizes natural sugars in the tomato, adding a touch of sweetness, while the acidity cuts the fat and richness of the nuts. Yellow or butternut squash can be used in place of the zucchini with equally delicious results. 

Low sodium. High potassium. High phosphorus. For a medium-potassium and medium-phosphorus dish, use regular spaghetti instead of whole wheat and decrease the tomatoes and zucchini to 1 cup each. This also significantly reduces the fiber in the dish, so make this modification only if you need a low-potassium diet

Ingredients:
1 PINT GRAPE TOMATOES 
1/2 CUP EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, DIVIDED 
6 TABLESPOONS PINE NUTS, DIVIDED 
1 LARGE ZUCCHINI 
1 1/2 CUPS FRESH BASIL LEAVES 
1/3 CUP UNROASTED, UNSALTED CASHEWS 
2 CLOVES GARLIC 
1 TABLESPOON LEMON JUICE 
8 OUNCES WHOLE-WHEAT SPAGHETTI 
VEGAN PARMESAN CHEESE OR NUTRITIONAL YEAST, OPTIONAL, FOR GARNISH 
FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER, TO TASTE 

Instructions:
1. Heat the oven to 400°F. Cut the tomatoes in half, place on a baking sheet, and toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Place the pine nuts in one corner of the baking sheet. Roast until pine nuts are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the nuts from the pan, set aside. Return the pan to the oven and continue roasting the tomatoes until blistered, about 10 minutes, set aside. 

2. Using a spiralizer, julienne peeler, or mandolin fitted with a julienne blade, julienne the zucchini into long, thin noodle-like strands, set aside. 

3. Place ¼ cup toasted pine nuts, basil, cashews, garlic, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor and process until combined. While the machine is running, slowly add the remaining oil through the top feed tube until incorporated. Season with pepper. 

4. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the spaghetti, cook according to package directions for al dente, and add the zucchini when two minutes remain. Drain the spaghetti and zucchini and return to the pot with the roasted cherry tomatoes over low heat. 

5. Gently fold the pesto into the pasta until combined. Season with pepper, if needed. Top with remaining toasted pine nuts and vegan parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast, if desired

Olive oil, low-fat milk, and vegetable stock reduces fat, whole-grain pasta increases fiber, and peas add protein and vitamins. Reduced-fat and vegan cheeses can also be used with equally tasty results. A 1 cup serving only has 443 calories, 20 grams of protein, 17 grams of fat and 284 mg of sodium. 

Ingredients:
1 16-OUNCE BOX WHOLE-GRAIN ELBOW PASTA 
2 TABLESPOONS ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR 
1 TABLESPOON BUTTER, OR BUTTER SUBSTITUTE 
1 TABLESPOON EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
1 1/4 CUPS 1% MILK OR NON DAIRY MILK
1 1/4 CUPS “NO-SODIUM VEGETABLE STOCK”
1/2 TEASPOON LOW-SODIUM HOT SAUCE, OR TO TASTE 
2 CUPS FRESHLY GRATED CHEDDAR CHEESE OR VEGAN CHEESE
1 10-OUNCE BAG FROZEN PEAS 
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil and add the pasta, stirring to prevent pasta from sticking together, cook for 2 minutes. Add the peas and cook until the pasta is al dente, about another 3–4 minutes, drain and set aside. 

2. Place the pot over medium-low heat and add butter and olive oil to melt. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon, making sure to reach the edges of the pot. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the roux from scorching. 

3. Increase heat to medium and gradually whisk in a few tablespoons of milk at a time, whisking until the milk is incorporated before adding more. Add the vegetable stock and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes. 

4. Gradually add the cheese, whisking until melted. Add the pasta and peas to the cheese sauce, stir to combine, and serve immediately.

NUTRITION SUMMARY & MODIFICATIONS: Medium sodium. Low potassium. High phosphorus. To lower the potassium and phosphorus, use regular pasta instead of whole-grain pasta and decrease the cheese amount to 1 cup total.

I was inspired by Mediterranean and South Asian cuisines, so I used olive oil instead of butter and added pistachio nuts and cardamom for flavor, texture, and scent. But the real star of the show here is the mandarin oranges, the richest fruit of the season. 

This dessert tastes decadent, but this dessert is low calorie and low fat. A slice is just under 200 calories. 

*Note: Use a sharp knife and take your time when slicing the mandarin oranges, the thinner the better. This cake also pairs well with 
almonds or walnuts in place of the pistachio nuts.

This easy and tasty dessert will be a great addition to your holiday table and can be found in my “Holiday Recipe Guide,” together with other healthy recipes, like Rustic Apple Tart, Orange Spiced Chicken, Honey Roasted Pears with Walnuts, Pomegranate & Phyllo and more.

Stuffed Cabbage Rolls 

Prep Time: 25 min. / Cook Time 2 hrs
Serves 6 

Ingredients:
1 lb. Ground Beef 85/15
1 Large Head of Cabbage 
3 Tbsp. Olive Oil 
1 Tbsp. Butter 
1 Medium Onion ( finely diced)
1 ½ Tbsp. Garlic (minced)
1 ½ Cups Mushrooms (chopped)  
¾ Cup uncooked White Rice (or for Low Carb - add Riced Cauliflower) 
4 Tbsp. chopped Fresh Parsley (reserve 1 Tbsp. for garnish)
1 15 oz Can Tomato Puree 
¾ Cup Beef Broth
1 ½ Tsp. Salt 
1 Tsp. Pepper 
1 Tsp. Garlic Powder 
1- 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce 
¾ Cup Diced Tomatoes 

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cut the center core out of the cabbage and place the core side down in boiling water. Cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or until leaves are softened.  Then place the cabbage on a baking pan and carefully start removing the loose outer layers of cabbage leaves with a fork, cutting them away with a knife from the core.  

Place each leaf on the baking pan and cut the thick spine with a knife so it will be easier to roll. If the inner leaves are not tender enough, you may need to put the cabbage head back into the boiling water for a few more minutes to soften them.

While cabbage is cooking, in a skillet on medium high heat, add olive oil and melt butter, then add onions and saute until they are translucent.  Add garlic and mushrooms and continue cooking for another 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside (you will be adding this to the meat mixture). 

In a large bowl, add ground beef, cooked onion, garlic and mushroom mixture, uncooked rice, parsley, 1 cup tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Combine well. 
In a small separate bowl, mix together the remaining 1 cup tomato puree and beef broth. Pour 3 to 4 large spoonfuls of the sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan. 
Divide your bowl of meat mixture into quarters. Each quarter will stuff 3 cabbage leaves for a total of 12 rolls.  Fill each leaf with a spoonful of the meat mixture.  Then as you are rolling them up, tuck in the sides and place them seam side down in the baking pan.  Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls and spoon some diced tomatoes on top. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake for 1 ½ hours (You may want to place the pan on a cookie sheet in case it drips).","['cabbage recipes', 'Shotgun Red', 'Cooking with shotgun red', 'Shotgun Red Recipes', 'cabbage recipes vegatarian', 'cabbage recipes vegetarian', 'cabbage recipes for weight loss', 'cabbage recipe', 'fried cabbage', 'cabbage steaks', 'stuffed cabbage rolls', 'cabbage steaks in oven', 'baked cabbage steaks', 'baked cabbage rolls', 'southern fried cabbage', 'baked cabbage recipes', 'cabbage', 'easy cabbage recipes', 'stuffed cabbage rolls recipe', 'how to cook cabbage steaks in oven', 'cabbage rolls']"

NOTE: Jiffy Cornbread Mix is already somewhat Sweet, you do not need to add anymore sugar, but it does make this recipe a little sweeter and gives it that sweet and salty taste!

Chili Cornbread Bake

INGREDIENTS:
2 Boxes Jiffy Cornbread Mix
2 Eggs
2/3 Cup of Milk
1-2 Tsp. Sugar (OPTIONAL)
2 Tbsp. Olive Oil
1 Sweet Onion (diced)
2 Lbs. Lean Ground Beef
2 Packets of Chili Seasoning
1-2 Cans Tomato (diced or crushed)
1-2 Cups Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend
Topping:
Sour Cream
Green Onion
Other Items:
Nonstick Cooking Spray
Parchment Paper

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees

In a bowl prepare the Jiffy Cornbread mix according to package directions. Adding additional sugar is optional.

Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with nonstick spray, then line it with a large piece of parchment paper. Pour the Jiffy cornbread batter into the pan, and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Then let cool for about 10 minutes.

While the cornbread is in the oven, in a large skillet on medium heat add olive oil, onion and then ground beef. Add one packet of seasoning to the meat and cook until meat is browned. Then stir in the tomatoes, and second seasoning packet and let it simmer for 5 minutes.

Now that the cornbread has cooled, use the bottom of a utensil with a handle that is about 1-inch in diameter, to poke multiple holes in the cornbread. Pour the chili over the cornbread and spread evenly. Top with shredded cheese, then place the baking dish back in the oven for 3 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. 

Cut into squares, top with sour cream and green onions and serve!","['30 minute dinner', '30 minute meals', 'Cooking with shotgun red', 'Shotgun Red', 'Shotgun Red Recipes', 'budget dinner recipes', 'cheap dinner ideas', 'cheap dinner recipes', 'chili', 'chili and cornbread', 'chili and cornbread bake', 'chili and cornbread recipe', 'chili cornbread bake', 'chili cornbread casserole', 'chili cornbread poke cake', 'chili cornbread recipe', 'cornbread chili bowl', 'cornbread recipe', 'easy cornbread', 'fast dinner recipes', 'how to make cornbread']"

A pinch of red chili flakes

Tomato sauce 👇🏽

For my lasagna I add 3 extra tomatoes to my tomato sauce. You can adjust the seasoning if you like by adding more of the seasoning that I already added or making it your own. 

Bake in the oven on 425 degrees for 25-30 minutes take the aluminum foil off and bake for another 5-10 minutes until the cheese melts or broil it for 1-2 minutes. Let it cook down for about 20 minutes then enjoy! 😍",

It is made across the country and is drunk both at home and at tiny tea stalls on road sides everywhere. Interestingly, this beverage that so many people associate with India was actually not consumed until the time of the British Raj. India grew a large amount of tea in areas such as Assam and Darjeeling, however, the majority of Indians consumed coffee. The British East India Company became concerned as they realized they were losing a vast source of income to the Chinese, who had a virtual monopoly on tea sales. Thus, the East India Company began promoting tea to Indians. At first, the Indians were skeptical and did not want to abandon their strongly flavored coffee. But eventually, someone added strongly flavored spices to a sweet and milky tea and masala chai took off! The chai is sweet and spicy with a subtle burn at the back of the throat. It is, in a word, wonderful.

These traditional sweets are made during Ganesh Chaturthi Festival in India.
Recipe link: https://youtube.com/shorts/cz2Jw97alno

Ingredients & Quantity

For the filling
▢1 cup grated coconut am using frozen, fresh, or desiccated can be used too.
▢½ cup grated Sugarcane Jaggery
▢½ teaspoon cardamom powder
▢15 cashews coarsely chopped, optional

For the covering:
▢1 cup water
▢1 cup rice flour fine variety
▢1 teaspoon ghee + more for greasing
▢¼ teaspoon salt

Method,
To make coconut jaggery filling:
Heat a pan on medium heat and dry roast the coconut for 5 mins to dry out the moisture if any. I've used frozen, thawed coconut. Fresh coconut can be used too.
Add the grated jaggery, mix till it's melted and well combined. Stir in the cardamom powder, saffron, and cashew pieces (optional).
Keep stirring continuously (approximately 2 mins) until the mixture is almost dry. Turn off the heat and keep it aside to cool slightly. Don't overcook the jaggery coconut filling else it will turn hard. 
While the coconut jaggery mixture (also known as saran) cools, let's make the outer covering. 

To make the outer covering:
In a pot or saucepan, water, add salt and 1 teaspoon of ghee. Bring it to a boil. 
Stir in the rice flour and mix well using a spoon or spatula. The mixture should be soft, lumpy, and crumbly. Turn off the heat. Cover the pot and let this mixture sit for 5 mins. 
Transfer the rice flour mixture to a plate and allow it to cool a bit enough to handle but still warm.
Knead the dough for 5 mins using 1-2 tablespoon water (or as needed) and 1-2 teaspoon ghee into a smooth, soft dough.  It shouldn’t be cracked or crumbly.  Keep covered at all times with a wet cloth to prevent it from drying. 
Divide dough and filling equal portions.
You can either make modak freehand or using molds. There are two types of mold available aluminum ones and plastic. I've used the aluminum mold.

To make modak using mold:
Grease your plate or steamer basket.
Open the molds and apply ghee to the inside of the mold. Place one dough ball and close the mold.
From the open side, start pressing and spreading the dough using fingers as thin as possibly can but not too thin. The excess dough will come out of the mold, either cut it or leave it there. It can be used to close the modak.
Place a portion of the filling in the hollow and use the excess covering to close the modak. Remove any excess dough that you see on the joints of the mold.
Open the modak mold place them in the steamer basket.
Slowly open the mold and remove the modak gently. Place it on a greased steamer basket.
Optional Step : Add 1-2 threads of saffron on top of each modak (optional step)
Continue making the remaining modak in a similar manner. Ensure to grease your mold before making the next modak

Steaming Ukadiche Modak on the stove top
Place 2 cups of water in the pot and bring it to a boil. Place the steamer basket with modak inside. Close and steam on medium heat covered for 10-12 mins.
Turn off the heat, allow to cool for 5 mins in pot itself. Take the basket out and cool for another 5 mins. Then transfer to a plate.

The multi-layered cake is made up of thin layers of a coconut flavored batter separated by melted ghee (clarified butter). Bebinca requires patience and a lot of time and
best results can be achieved only by following the traditional method of baking, which involves using a special earthenware oven called tizals. Unlike other baked desserts, Bebinca made in these pots is not baked over a fire but by placing a few burning coconut husks over the lid.
Recipe link- https://youtu.be/NqR5VVtE44o

Ingredients & Quantity

Egg yolks - 12 nos
Thick Coconut milk - 750 ml
Sugar - 450 Gms
Cardamom powder - 1 tsp
Refined Flour - 200 Gms
Salt - 1/4 tsp
Clarified Butter (Ghee) - 100 Gms

Method
1) Separate the egg yolks from egg whites and whisk the egg yolks until creamy.
2) Mix the coconut milk and sugar together and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
3) Add the coconut milk to egg yolks and mix well.
4) Add all the flour to the coconut and egg yolks mixture and add cardamon powder to flavour.
5) Preheat oven at 180 degree Celsius.
Put 1 tbsp of ghee in the baking pan, pour some of the prepared batter into it to form 1/4’ thick layer. 

* (for this traditional method first burn the coconut husk under the pot simultaneously burn the coconut husk into the second pot once there's enough heat in the first pot, place your baking tin with the first layer and cover it with the 2 pot, each layer takes around 15 mins depending on the amount of heat, for me it took approx 9 hours to create this Bebinca, this method is time consuming but trust me it gives the best results if done with full dedication)

6) Put it in the oven and cook till the top is golden, monitor frequently by giving more heat from top.
7) Once you get desired colour, add another tbsp of ghee on previous layer.
Now pour another layer of batter of the same thickness as the previous one cook in the oven until golden brown.
8) Keep repeating the layering process till all the batter is used up.
The last layer must be of ghee when it is done turn the bebinca over a flat dish or cut into wedges and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream.

Officers began responding to calls reporting a white Toyota Camry speeding northbound in southbound lanes of the SR-73 Freeway near Laguna Canyon Road around 12:16 AM.

Before officers could arrive subsequent callers reported that the Toyota collided with a white 2016 Buick Enclave at Newport Coast Drive.

At the scene authorities located both vehicles with heavy damage and debris blocking all lanes.

Three women in the Buick along with the driver of the Toyota were trapped in the wreckage and had to be freed by firefighters in a process that lasted about 30 minutes.

All four trapped victims, along with another occupant of the Buick that appeared uninjured, were rushed to nearby hospitals in varying conditions.

At least one of the four, believed to be the driver of the Toyota, was the subject of a DUI investigation.

A white Toyota Tacoma struck debris in the roadway and sustained a flat tire but was not involved in the initial impact.

All southbound lanes of the SR-73 Freeway were closed at Newport Coast Driver for about two hours while crews worked to clear the scene.

The rider lost control and crashed on East 4th Street near Poinsettia Street North around 12:50 AM after fleeing police and prompting a pursuit that lasted just over a minute.

Officers quickly detained the rider who was later treated at the scene and transported to an area hospital.

It was unclear what prompted the pursuit or what charges the rider might be facing.

That street vendor was preparing to sell food in 1900 block of West 1st Street when authorities warned them against unpermitted food sales around 7:00 PM, according to a source associated with the business who asked not to be identified.

The vendor nonetheless began selling food to a steady flow of customers that came and went from the impromptu stand before code enforcement officials and police officers returned around 9:45 PM.

City officials seized the vendor's food, telling them it would be discarded, and took photos of vehicles believed to be owned by people affiliated with the vendor, the source added.

No criminal or civil citations were issued but the vendors did receive what appeared to be a written warning.

Several other vendors were treated similarly in what appeared to be an unannounced enforcement blitz, according to radio traffic and social media reports.

The gunfire erupted in the Geneva Presbyterian Church, located in the 24300 block of El Toro Road, sometime around 1:26 PM.

When deputies arrived they located multiple adult gunshot victims and detained a male suspect along with a firearm.

Firefighter paramedics pronounced one victim deceased at the scene and transported five others to area hospitals for treatment.

Four of the five victims were described as being in critical, but stable, condition.

The suspect, who was not immediately identified, was evaluated by paramedics at the scene.

It was unclear what motivated the deadly shooting although an extensive inquiry into the incident is underway.

At least a portion of the incident was captured on a livestream of the congregation's service but that video was quickly removed.

Anyone with information regarding the incident was urged to contact the Orange County Crime Stoppers by calling (855) TIP-OCCS or by visiting their website at www.occrimestoppers.org.

The film will be released in UK cinemas nationwide from 7th October, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the discovery:  
 
In 2012, having been lost for over 500 years, the remains of King Richard III were discovered beneath a carpark in Leicester.  The search had been orchestrated by an amateur historian, Philippa Langley, whose unrelenting research had been met with incomprehension by her friends and family and with scepticism by experts and academics.

The Lost King is the life-affirming true story of a woman who refused to be ignored and who took on the country's most eminent historians, forcing them to think again about one of the most controversial kings in England's history.

The animated video promotes the phone app which helps food banks all over the country get the supplies they need, exactly when they need them and #NotJustBakedBeans.
 
BanktheFood is calling on people to download the app which pings donors a list of urgently needed items from their local food bank at the most crucial time - when they arrive at the supermarket. Shoppers can then add an item to their shop and donate it at the local donation station.
 
There are more than 2,000 food banks in the UK, but they rely heavily on notice boards in supermarkets and ad hoc social media posts to get their needs across. These quickly become out of date and fail to reach those willing to help. The BanktheFood app tells donors exactly what foodbanks need, at the crucial time - when they enter the supermarket, making donating more effective and reducing waste and the need for costly storage.
 
Joe Lycett explains: ""I was shocked to hear how many food banks there are in the UK and how much pressure they are under. Like many of us, I try to support but often feel like I’m guessing at what to buy when in the supermarket. BanktheFood is a frankly brilliant idea that will hopefully help the thousands of food banks in the UK get the supplies they need, when they need them. I'm proud to support them.""
 
Emma Spring, CEO at BanktheFood, said: ""We are incredibly grateful to Joe for supporting our us and narrating our new mission film. It’s no secret that food banks urgently need donations to help the community. But often generous donors unintentionally donate the same items. BanktheFood is a charity on a mission to ensure food banks have the right balance of what they need, when they need it. The BanktheFood app ensures donations are #NotJustBakedBeans. We hope as many people as possible will use the app.""

Comedian John Robins is helping to front the awareness campaign. He says: “Gambling didn't just cost me money, it also cost me friendships and my self-esteem. It left me isolated and in total despair. And it almost cost me my life. There are many people too afraid to seek help for gambling harms, but let me reassure you, it was the best thing I did. Everything I've done with my life has only been possible because of the help I received to stop gambling. You are not alone, and please don’t sit there in silence.

Weherahena ( Veherahena) is popular temple among the buddhist pilgrims. Although there is nothing of historical significance, the story of the temple is quite interesting. In addition, the temple is said be the largest and the first tunnel temple in the world.

The even though it is said this temple was adobe to arhath bikkus in the ancient Sri Lanka, the story of the temple starts during the early part of the 20th centaury. The Most Rev. Parawahera Rewatha Thero was sent to Weherahena area in the early part of centaury as a punishment by his teacher. Weherahena was just a mound of 1/2 acre of think Jungle with only a Bodhi Tree. It is said that Ven. Revatha Thero came only with an blanket, mattress and the bowl.



 
He managed to get the villagers organised and built a small clay house for him self but soon came with a grand idea of building the largest buddha statue in the world. He also wanted to build a tunnel temple as in ummaga jathaka story.

With the support of Anagarika Dharmapala, one of the leaders in Buddhist Revival of Sri Lanka and India, Anagarika Dharmapala kept the foundation stone to the temple in 1939 with great blessings. The 600 feet tunnel was fist build by excavating the mound of earth. Once this was completed, the 88 cubit (39 metres) buddha statue was started. The statue was completed in 1976. The whole length of the tunnel is decorated with various scenes from Jataka stories. The cover over the buddha statue has been build with the financial assistance of a generous donor from Japan after 1976.","['weherahena temple', 'weherahena sri lanka', 'matara sri lanka']"

Here there are tons of restaurants and Bodegas where the Port wine is stored and bottled. I tried 10 year old Tawny Port, they can go much older. To go with it I tried the famous sandwich from Porto, called a Francesinha (which translates to French Girl) . It's like a giant grilled cheese sandwich, but with sausage, steak, bologna and more. Then it's smothered with cheese and set in a bowl of thick tomato soup. What a treat today!

From activities like fishing, surfing, horseback riding, metal detecting, and of course -- dog walking! Formby Beach offers something for all. Formby Beach is also wheelchair accessible from the car park making it easily available to everyone. So if the United Kingdom is experiencing a heat wave and you’re near Manchester or Liverpool, then Formby Beach is a welcoming oasis for tourists and residents alike.

King Charles III along with the Royal Family;  Princess Royal; Anne, Earl of Wessex; Prince Edward, and the Duke of York; Prince Andrew, walked behind the Queen’s coffin procession from Holyrood Palace to St Giles Cathedral. We were among tens of thousands of UK citizens and tourists who lined the royal mile to watch the procession and honor the memory of Queen Elizabeth II. 

We had already planned on being in Edinburgh, however, once the Queen passed and Operation Unicorn was put into place, everything in Edinburgh changed. Streets were blocked off, Edinburgh castle was closed, many tourist activities were stopped, hotel prices skyrocketed and thousands of people traveled to the city from all over the UK. 

Queen Elizabeth II passed on September 8th in Balmoral Castle, which is a large estate owned by the British Royal family and located in Scotland. It was one of her favorite places to stay and we were told that the Queen actually said that she wanted to die in Scotland. 

Elizabeth the II served as Queen for 70 years making her the longest serving British monarch. Many UK citizens have never known a different monarch. A Scot was actually quoted saying “She’s like another grannie to me.” So you can imagine how the citizens of the United Kingdom felt upon hearing the news that their queen had passed. 

As you’ll see in this video, citizens bowed as her coffin passed, others cried, and many turned towards their friends and loved ones for condolences. 

As Americans we share this video in hopes to capture some of the gathering we witnessed and honor the ceremony that took place.

Did Queen Elizabeth II have a direct or indirect impact in your life?

Megan has tried searching for Puffins every time we’ve visited Scotland, however, they’ve often migrated right before we get to this magnificent country.

But this time we’re determined to find them! 

Our day trip includes taking the Caledonian MacBrayne Ferry to the Isle of Mull to explore the colorful seaside town of Tobermory. Plus we search the Isle of Mull for its famous Puffin colonies and explore the legendary Fingal's Cave.

Visiting Garden of the Gods in winter was a special sight. As you'll see, the unique and colorful rock formations piercing out of the snow and into the sky is truly breathtaking.

If you’re asking “Should I visit Garden of the Gods?”, the answer is ""YES"". The Garden of the Gods is a must see! We drove down from Denver which took a little over an hour. So even if you’re looking for things to do around Denver, then it’s just a short drive. 

Hiking Garden of the Gods in January was a bit of a challenge, as the temperature dropped and the winds picked up, so be sure to dress in layers if you’re there during winter.

For more information like; the admission cost, how Garden of the Gods got its name, what to wear, and where to stay check out our blog post;

Over thousands and maybe even millions of years, the Colorado River created a unique ‘horseshoe’ shape from the sandstone. Located in Page, Arizona, this natural formation attracts thousands of visitors a year making it one of the most photographed places in Arizona. So is it worth the hype?

If you’re looking for things to do near Las Vegas, and have the time, then exploring horseshoe bend is worth the stop. Hiking Horseshoe Bend only takes about 10-15 minutes in one direction. And in our opinion, waking up and catching the sunrise at horseshoe bend is a must! Plus, you’ll beat all the crowds. 

If you’re looking for other things to do in Page, Arizona, then we recommend checking out Antelope Canyon. It’s only about a 15 minute drive from Horseshoe Bend.

Hiking the Acatenango Volcano in Guatemala, was one of our most challenging, yet most rewarding travel experiences to date. 

While living in Antigua, Guatemala, I wanted to surprise Megan with a birthday adventure. I thought, how cool would it be to experience her birthday camping on the top of a volcano?! All while watching another volcano, Volcan de Fuego, erupt in the distance. Well as you’ll see and hear in the video, it was quite the experience indeed!

Then take you to Dublin, Ireland, to grab a Guinness from the Guinness Storehouse. 

From there we celebrate Andrew’s birthday in Rome, Italy, by visiting the Colosseum, Roman, Forum, Vatican, and Trevi Fountain. 

We decide to make Scotland our home base for a while. Staying in Dunfermline, Dundee, and Edinburgh. 

While we’re there we stop over to Portugal. And explore Lisbon, the Algarve Region, and the Bengali Cave. Before making our way to Madrid, Spain.

We get waffles in Brussels, Belgium and float down the canals of Bruges.

Winter hits Scotland, and a little something else, that led us to make our next big travel decision.

🛎 Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/AndrewandMegan?sub_confirmation=1

Vermont was Andrew’s last state to check off of the east coast of the US, so obviously we had to hop in the car for a 50+ hour round trip adventure... obviously.

On this road trip to Killington, Vermont we stop in Charleston, South Carolina to spend time with friends. Unfortunately, shortly after leaving our friends we find out some bad news and our road trip is paused for a few days.

After hitting the road again, we drive through the night and end up in Killington, Vermont, where we start looking for the best Vermont maple syrup to put on my pancakes. 

To our surprise, we not only found some great tasting maple syrup, Megan and I, learn how to make maple syrup as well!

We celebrate with some maple syrup shots and thank Jena and Jacob for their great Vermont hospitality. 

If you’re looking for the BEST Vermont maple syrup farm tour…

Even though bars were closed, and Bourbon Street was blocked off, the spirit of Mardi Gras lived on in what they call “Yardi Gras”.

Instead of having parades and the usual festivities, hundreds of New Orleans residents found a new way to party this year, and that was by transforming their homes and businesses into Mardi Gras floats. From Dinosaurs to Movie sets, there was something for everyone. 

On Fat Tuesday, residents and visitors ventured out to marvel at the extreme decorations and themes that people put in their yards.

As we drove through the suburban neighborhoods celebrating Yardi Gras, we realized that we can all learn something from the residents of New Orleans, and that is…

No matter what happens, we can come together during some of the hardest times, and 2021 is no exception. 

Watch this video to see how the celebration of Mardi Gras lives on!

We’re frequently in the Los Angeles area for work, and as much as we love to explore the Hollywood Hills and glamorous streets, we LOVE finding the hidden gems even more.

And shortly outside of Los Angeles, we found more hidden gems than expected.

In this video we show off:

0:21 - Costa Mesa, CA 
2:28 - Solvang, CA (California Danish Village)
5:51 - Los Alamos, CA (Old Western Town)
7:07 - Morro Bay, CA 

We loved finding the best food (and pastries) along the way too, here’s where we stopped:

Blackmarket Bakery (Costa Mesa) - https://goo.gl/maps/5gAUTYX72oV8cHVb6
The Red Viking (Solvang) - https://goo.gl/maps/vynBpNhmsxLwRpot8
The Danish Mill Bakery (Solvang) - https://goo.gl/maps/KUW8zQyJmVpaRdEJ9
Not in the video, but an Instagram exclusive - In Morro Bay we ate some incredible fish and clam chowder at Tognazzini's Dockside Restaurant - https://goo.gl/maps/6w2TCkT2tT6P6z628

There’s even a few new regulations we hope will continue after the pandemic. 

Our work required us to continue traveling throughout 2020, and while at first it was empty flights with just a few business travelers on board, travel in 2021 is looking a little different already.

Watch what it’s like to travel during the pandemic, things we hope airports will keep, plus what would a travel day be without an unexpected ending…

DISCLAIMER: We share our own personal experience in this video. As stated, it is important to follow all CDC guidelines and local regulations for where you are traveling to and from.

The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team based in San Diego. The Padres compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Founded in 1969, the club has won two NL pennants—in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both years. As of 2022, they have had 16 winning seasons in franchise history.[3][4] The Padres are one of two Major League Baseball teams (the other being the Los Angeles Angels) in California to originate from the state; the Athletics were originally from Philadelphia (and moved to the state from Kansas City), and the Dodgers and Giants are originally from two New York City boroughs—Brooklyn and Manhattan, respectively. The Padres are the only team in California not to have won a World Series.

The Gaslamp Quarter is a 16½-block neighborhood in the downtown area of San Diego, California. It extends from Broadway to Harbor Drive, and from 4th to 6th Avenue.

Listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as Gaslamp Quarter Historic District, it includes 94 historic buildings, most of which were constructed in the Victorian Era; many are in use as restaurants, shops, entertainment venues, and nightclubs.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslamp_Quarter%2C_San_Diego

Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization and the oldest major professional sports league in the world.[B] MLB is composed of 30 total teams, divided equally between the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), with 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. The NL and AL were formed in 1876 and 1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues signed the National Agreement and cooperated but remained legally separate entities until 2000, when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball.[3][17][18] MLB is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team based in San Diego. The Padres compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Founded in 1969, the club has won two NL pennants—in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both years. As of 2021, they have had 15 winning seasons in franchise history.[3][4] The Padres are one of two Major League Baseball teams (the other being the Los Angeles Angels) in California to originate from the state; the Athletics were originally from Philadelphia (and moved to the state from Kansas City), and the Dodgers and Giants are originally from two New York City boroughs—Brooklyn and Manhattan, respectively. The Padres are the only team in California not to have won a World Series.

Following the relocation of the Chargers to Los Angeles in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the four major American professional sports leagues in the San Diego sports market.

Seaport Village is a waterfront shopping and dining complex adjacent to San Diego Bay in downtown San Diego, California. It is located at 849 West Harbor Drive, at the intersection of Harbor Drive and Kettner.[1]

It houses more than 70 shops, galleries, and eateries on 90,000 square feet (8,000 m2) of waterfront property. The Village contains several freestanding buildings in an assortment of architectural styles, from Victorian to traditional Mexican. It is designed to be a car-free environment, with four miles (6 km) of winding paths rather than streets connecting the various buildings. It is located in walking distance from the San Diego Convention Center and the cruise ship terminal. It is currently under redevelopment planning, with construction to begin approximately 2025. It will remain operational until construction begins, according to the Port District.[2]

The Embarcadero in San Diego, California is the area along the San Diego harbor on the east side of San Diego Bay. ""Embarcadero"" is a Spanish word meaning ""boarding place"". The Embarcadero sits on property administered by the Port of San Diego, in the Columbia district of Downtown San Diego.

The Embarcadero is home to the International Cruise Ship Terminal on World Pier, the museum ships USS Midway at Navy Pier and Star of India, seven other historic vessels belonging to the San Diego Maritime Museum on Discovery Pier, and various restaurants and shops from the North Embarcadero down through Seaport Village. The Port is redeveloping the historic Broadway Pier to create a second cruise-ship pier and terminal. That project is slated for completion in December 2010.

A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

Pacific Beach is a neighborhood in San Diego, bounded by La Jolla to the north, Mission Beach and Mission Bay to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.[1] While formerly largely populated by young people, surfers, and college students, because of rising property and rental costs the population is gradually becoming older and more affluent.[2] ""P.B.,"" as it is known as by local residents, is home to one of San Diego's more developed nightlife scenes, with a great variety of bars, eateries, and clothing stores located along Garnet Avenue and Mission Boulevard.

Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs—even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.[1]

The swells that often roll in from the open ocean can be large and strong. The water temperature is often a little colder than the average San Diego beach. While the beach has only a small dry sand area at high tide, during very low tides, tide pools are revealed at the cove.

California sea lions can be found in the waters of the Cove and hauling out, temporarily leaving the water to rest on its beaches, cliffs, and bluffs. Similar to the events of the Pacific harbor seals at Children's Pool Beach, there is controversy concerning the interactions of people with the sea lions.

North Park is a neighborhood in San Diego, California, United States, as well as a larger ""community"" as defined by the City of San Diego for planning purposes.[1] The neighborhood is bounded:[2]

on the northwest by Park Boulevard and University Heights
on the west by Florida Canyon and both University Heights and Hillcrest
on the southwest by Balboa Park
on the south by Switzer Canyon[3][4] and the South Park neighborhood
on the east by Interstate 805 and City Heights
The pre-Interstate 805 boundary of North Park was widely considered to be 35th Street, which is now part of City Heights.

It includes the sub-neighborhoods of Burlingame, Altadena, and the Morley Field area (site of the Dryden Historic District). North Park is part of the 53rd congressional district, and San Diego City Council District 3.

The ""community"" of North Park as defined for planning purposes includes University Heights on the north and Juniper Canyon as the southern boundary, thus including as far southeast as Cedar Ridge Park in the officially defined community.[1]

The North Park sign can be seen at 30th Street and University Avenue, and this intersection is considered to be the heart of the neighborhood. San Diego's first suburbs began appearing in the late 19th century, including South Park in 1870 and North Park in 1893, along with what would eventually become the 30th Street corridor. In 1905, the Bartlett Webster developing company extended streetcar service through South Park, ushering in a period of rapid growth. In 1912, North Park's first high-rise, known today as the Western Dental Building, was built on the corner of 30th Street and University Avenue.[2]

To accommodate transit between these quickly developing neighborhoods, the 30th Street trolley bridge, a wood and steel truss bridge, was built in 1908 across Switzer Canyon.[3] In 1956, the aging original bridge was demolished and replaced in 1957 with the 30th Street causeway which remains to this day.

Between the 1930s and the 1950s, the intersection of 30th Street and University Avenue in North Park was one of San Diego's major city centers.[4] However, as was seen in many urban areas throughout the United States, white flight and suburbanization in the latter half of the 20th century devastated many communities along the 30th Street corridor. The early 2000s have witnessed a resurgence in these historic neighborhoods due to new urbanism.[5] Across its communities, 30th Street has seen many shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants open in the last decade contributing to high rates of pedestrian activity.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park%2C_San_Diego

30th Street is a major north-south road in San Diego, California on the east side of Balboa Park. It connects several of the densest urban communities of Central San Diego and has a high rate of pedestrian activity. In recent years, 30th Street has become known nationally for its prominent craft beer culture.[1]

San Diego (/ˌsæn diˈeɪɡoʊ/, Spanish: [san ˈdjeɣo]; Spanish for 'Saint Didacus') is a city in the U.S. state of California on the coast of the Pacific Ocean and immediately adjacent to the United States–Mexico border. With an estimated population of 1,423,851 as of July 1, 2019,[10] San Diego is the eighth most populous city in the United States and second most populous in California (after Los Angeles). The city is the county seat of San Diego County, the fifth most populous county in the United States, with 3,338,330 estimated residents as of 2019. The city is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy and Marine Corps, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center.

Sunset Cliffs is an affluent coastal community in the Point Loma community of San Diego, California. It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, Ocean Beach on the north, Catalina Blvd. and Santa Barbara St. on the east, and Sunset Cliffs Natural Park on the south.[1]

The area is named for the sheer cliffs which border the ocean. There are surfing spots below the cliffs. The cliffside trails are popular for walking and for watching the sunset, but are undeveloped and can be dangerous. Falls from the cliffs have resulted in deaths[2][3] and injuries.[4][5]

The main street of the area is Sunset Cliffs Blvd. The neighborhood is almost entirely residential, with curved contour-following streets and custom homes. A small commercial strip is found along the northern end of Sunset Cliffs Blvd. running into Ocean Beach. The area contains Sunset View Elementary School, part of the San Diego City Schools, as well as a private elementary/middle school called Warren-Walker School.

Little Italy is a neighborhood in Downtown San Diego, California, that was originally a predominantly Italian and Portuguese fishing neighborhood. It has since been gentrified and is now a popular neighborhood full of Italian restaurants and grocery stores, home design stores, art galleries and residential units.

Little Italy is one of the more active downtown neighborhoods, with frequent festivals and events including a weekly farmers market, also known as the Mercato (the Market, in Italian). The neighborhood has low crime rates when compared with other neighborhoods in Downtown San Diego[2] and is maintained by the Little Italy Neighborhood Association, which looks after trash collection, decorations, and special events.

Belmont Park is a historic amusement park located on Ocean Front at Surfrider Square in the Mission Bay area of San Diego, California. The park was developed by sugar magnate John D. Spreckels and opened on July 4, 1925 as the Mission Beach Amusement Center.[1] In addition to providing recreation and amusement, it also was intended as a way to help Spreckels sell land in Mission Beach. Located on the beach, it attracts millions of people each year.

The park's most iconic attraction is the historic Giant Dipper roller coaster, which is considered a local landmark.[2]

Mission Beach is a community built on a sandbar between the Pacific Ocean and Mission Bay. It is part of the city of San Diego, California.

Mission Beach spans nearly two miles of ocean front. It is bounded by the San Diego River estuary on the south, Mission Bay Park on the east, and the community of Pacific Beach on the north. A boardwalk runs along the beaches on both the ocean and bay sides of the community. The main artery through Mission Beach is Mission Boulevard. The community is divided into South Mission, a peninsula, and North Mission. At the south end of the beach a jetty, with grass, parking and a walk, extends into the ocean.

Coronado (Spanish for ""Crowned"") is a resort city located in San Diego County, California, United States, across the San Diego Bay from downtown San Diego.[5] It was founded in the 1880s and incorporated in 1890. Its population was 24,697 at the 2010 census,[6][7] up from 24,100 at the 2000 census. Coronado is a tied island which is connected to the mainland by a tombolo (a sandy isthmus) called the Silver Strand. The explorer Sebastian Vizcaino gave Coronado its name and drew its first map in 1602. Coronado is Spanish term for ""crowned"" and thus it is nicknamed The Crown City. Its name is derived from the Coronado Islands, an offshore Mexican archipelago.[8] Three ships of the United States Navy have been named after the city, including USS Coronado.

San Diego Comic-Con International is a comic book convention and nonprofit[2] multi-genre entertainment event held annually in San Diego, California, United States since 1970. The name, as given on its website, is Comic-Con International: San Diego; but it is commonly known simply as Comic-Con or the San Diego Comic-Con or ""SDCC"".[3][4]

The convention was founded as the Golden State Comic Book Convention in 1970 by a group of San Diegans that included Shel Dorf, Richard Alf, Ken Krueger, Ron Graf, and Mike Towry;[5][6][7][8][9] later, it was called the ""San Diego Comic Book Convention"", Dorf said during an interview that he hoped the first Con would bring in 500 attendees.[10] It is a four-day event (Thursday–Sunday) held during the summer (in July since 2003) at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego. On the Wednesday evening prior to the official opening, professionals, exhibitors, and pre-registered guests for all four days can attend a pre-event ""Preview Night"" to give attendees the opportunity to walk the exhibit hall and see what will be available during the convention.

Located about 7 mi (11 km) northwest of Downtown San Diego, it sits south of Mission Bay and Mission Beach and directly north of Point Loma. The O.B. community planning area comprises about 1 square mile (742 acres),[1] bounded on the north by the San Diego River, on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Froude St., Seaside St. and West Point Loma Boulevard, and on the south by Adair Street.[2]

The Gaslamp Quarter is a 16½-block neighborhood in the downtown area of San Diego, California. It extends from Broadway to Harbor Drive, and from 4th to 6th Avenue.

Listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as Gaslamp Quarter Historic District, it includes 94 historic buildings, most of which were constructed in the Victorian Era; many are in use as restaurants, shops, entertainment venues, and nightclubs.

It is the site of various events and festivals, including Mardi Gras in the Gaslamp, Street Scene Music Festival, Taste of Gaslamp, and ShamROCK, a St. Patrick's Day event. Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, is one block away in the East Village neighborhood.

San Diegans generally refer to the area as ""the Gaslamp"", rarely ""Gaslamp Quarter"", as on the entryway arch and official city signage and banners.

The music festival emerged in England in the 18th century as an extension of urban concert life into a form of seasonal cultural festivity structured around a schedule of music performances or concerts.[1][2][3][page needed] It is generally an annually occurring event with more regular and extensive programming than more spontaneous or improvised forms of music festivity. Music festivals are generally organized by individuals or organizations within networks of music production, typically music scenes, the music industries, or institutions of music education. The music festival is the largest and one of the most important performance institutions in music life, a place for experiencing where the culture is at.[4][page needed]

In traditional genres such as folk and classical music, a music festival can be defined as a community event with performances of singing and instrument playing that is often presented with a theme such as musical genre (e.g., blues, folk, jazz, classical music), nationality, locality of musicians, or holiday.

Music festivals are commonly held outdoors, with tents or roofed temporary stages for the performers. Often music festivals host other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, dance, crafts, performance art, and social or cultural activities. At music festivals associated with charitable causes, there may be information about social or political issues. Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval. Some, including many rock festivals, are held only once.

Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific charitable cause.[5] Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually in local communities, regionally, or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement.

San Diego Pacific Beach | Pacific Beach San Diego |
Pacific Beach's namesake stretches for miles from the Mission Bay jetty to the cliffs of La Jolla. The boardwalk, officially called Ocean Front Walk/Ocean Boulevard, is a pedestrian walkway that runs approximately 3.2 miles along the beach from the end of Law St. in the north down into Mission Beach, ending at the mouth of Mission Bay in the south. There are numerous local shops, bars, hotels, and restaurants along the boardwalk, and it is generally crowded with pedestrians, cyclists, rollerbladers, skateboarder and shoppers. Adjacent to the boardwalk is the Crystal Pier, a public pier and hotel at the west end of Garnet Avenue. San Diego City Council banned the use of all electric-motor scooters in December of 2019.[3]

Streets
The streets in Pacific Beach were renamed several times before receiving their current designations in 1900.[4][5] The primary north-south street running parallel to the beach is Mission Blvd., with the streets named after late 19th century federal officials, then incrementing in alphabetical order as they move further from the coast: Bayard, Cass, Dawes, Everts, Fanuel, Gresham, Haines, Ingraham, Jewell, Kendall, Lamont, Morrell, Noyes, Olney, Pendleton, Quincy, Randall, and San Joaquin. Mission Boulevard was formerly Allison Street, being the ""A"" street of the series. Ingraham was initially named Broadway (1887), then was changed to Izard (1900), back to Broadway (1907) and finally settled as Ingraham Street in 1913.[5]

The east-west streets are mostly named after precious stones. Starting at the north end of Mission Blvd. and heading south, the streets are:

History

Crystal Pier, originally constructed in 1927
Before European-contact, the area was settled by the Kumeyaay people, who built a large village then known as Hamo, or Jamo, on the banks of Rose Creek at the entrance of Rose Canyon.

San Diego County, officially the County of San Diego, is a county in the southwestern corner of the state of California, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 3,095,313,[5] making it California's second-most populous county and the fifth-most populous in the United States. Its county seat is San Diego,[8] the second-most populous city in California and the eighth-most populous city in the United States. It is the southwesternmost county in the 48 contiguous United States, and is a border county.

A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

Nightlife has been a vibrant area of research for sociologists. Nightlife establishments including pubs, bars, and nightclubs function as third places, according to Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place.[3]

The Continental Congress declared that the thirteen American colonies were no longer subject (and subordinate) to the monarch of Britain, King George III, and were now united, free, and independent states.[1] The Congress had voted to declare independence two days earlier, on July 2, but it was not declared until July 4.[1]

Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, political speeches, and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the national day of the United States.

Pacific Beach is a neighborhood in San Diego, bounded by La Jolla to the north, Mission Beach and Mission Bay to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.[1] While formerly largely populated by young people, surfers, and college students, because of rising property and rental costs the population is gradually becoming older and more affluent.[2] ""P.B.,"" as it is known as by local residents, is home to one of San Diego's more developed nightlife scenes, with a great variety of bars, eateries, and clothing stores located along Garnet Avenue and Mission Boulevard.

Mission Beach is a community built on a sandbar between the Pacific Ocean and Mission Bay. It is part of the city of San Diego, California.

Mission Beach spans nearly two miles of ocean front. It is bounded by the San Diego River estuary on the south, Mission Bay Park on the east, and the community of Pacific Beach on the north. A boardwalk runs along the beaches on both the ocean and bay sides of the community. The main artery through Mission Beach is Mission Boulevard. The community is divided into South Mission, a peninsula, and North Mission. At the south end of the beach a jetty, with grass, parking and a walk, extends into the ocean.
Attractions near Mission Beach include SeaWorld in Mission Bay Park and the historic amusement park Belmont Park in South Mission Beach. Belmont Park was originally built as the Mission Beach Amusement Center[5] by John D. Spreckels in 1925 to stimulate real estate sales and to promote his electric railway. Belmont Park now features the original wooden Giant Dipper Roller Coaster as well as newer rides such as the FlowRider at Wave House,[6] Vertical Plunge, Krazy Kars, Tilt-a-Whirl, Liberty Carousel, Crazy Submarine, The Beach Blaster, and The Chaos.

Designed by architect Frank Walter Stevenson, The Mission Beach Plunge in Belmont Park, a 60-foot (18 m)-by-175-foot (53 m) saltwater swimming pool, opened in May 1925 as the Natatorium. The Plunge building enclosing the pool was styled after the Spanish Renaissance architecture of San Diego's Balboa Park structures. The changing rooms appear in the Tom Cruise film Top Gun.[7] Celebrities who once swam at the Plunge include Esther Williams and Johnny Weissmuller. The roof of the building rolled open to make it both an indoor and outdoor pool.[8] The Mission Beach Plunge (now using fresh water) and the Giant Dipper are the only remaining attractions left from Spreckels' original park; the other structures were razed in the late 1980s. The Plunge has been closed since 2014 due to disrepair. Plans to demolish and rebuild the Plunge were approved in January 2016.[9]
Mission Beach offers opportunities to participate in sunbathing, horseshoes, surfing, bicycling, skateboarding, Frisbee tossing, and other outdoor activities. A local skating club, ""Skate This!,"" performs for free on weekends, executing trick skating and dancing on both rollerblades and traditional skates. It is a well known, popular location for engaging in sports, including beach volleyball[11] and basketball, with courts available for both.

There is a public recreation center on Santa Clara Place on the bay side of Mission Beach. At the south end of Belmont Park is the Wave House Athletic Club, a full-service beachside fitness center, complete with cardio equipment, weights, fitness classes, aquatic classes in the Plunge, and beach Bootcamps.

Mission Beach includes Mariner's Point, the original site of the over-the-line softball-on-the-beach tournament.

Thong bikinis are technically illegal on Mission Beach, but lifeguards and local police do not typically enforce the ban on such swimwear. The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the beach is illegal as of April 2008. Nudity is not allowed.

Many beachgoers are local college and university students, but both tourists and permanent residents of the beach and other areas are also frequent visitors to the beach. Weekly and monthly rentals are available during the summer months.

Pacific Beach is a neighborhood in San Diego, bounded by La Jolla to the north, Mission Beach and Mission Bay to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.[1] While formerly largely populated by young people, surfers, and college students, because of rising property and rental costs the population is gradually becoming older and more affluent.[2] ""P.B.,"" as it is known as by local residents, is home to one of San Diego's more developed nightlife scenes, with a great variety of bars, eateries, and clothing stores located along Garnet Avenue and Mission Boulevard.
Since it is a just a neighborhood of San Diego, California, shouldn't the name be Pacific Beach, San Diego, California? I know that is how all the neighborhoods for the City of Los Angeles are listed. BlankVerse ∅ 11:23, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Comment. I also suggest Pacific Beach, San Diego, California, just like all the neighborhoods for Los Angeles.Zzyzx11 18:38, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
On second thought, let me get back to you on Pacific Beach, San Diego, California since I'm not sure about the general policy. At the very least, it should be renamed to Pacific Beach, California so it would be specific. Zzyzx11 18:46, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Looking at the articles in Category:Neighborhoods of the U.S., there does not seem to be a clear cut standard. In Category:Chicago neighborhoods, the articles are named ""{NAME}, Chicago"". But in Category:Neighborhoods of Honolulu, the articles are named ""{NAME}, Hawaii"". Category:Salt Lake City neighborhoods has it in the form ""{NAME} (Salt Lake City)"". Zzyzx11 12:49, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Support weakly Pacific Beach, San Diego or the longer version with CA above would seem to be more wiki like from what little I have seen.Vegaswikian 09:17, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Move, please. ""Pacific Beach"" is too general, too confusing. Pacific Beach, San Diego seems like a fine target. Jonathunder 04:09, 2005 Mar 25 (UTC)
Strong oppose Pacific Beach, California--implies it's a city. Pacific Beach, San Diego, California and Pacific Beach, San Diego are better, but are forms of disambiguation, and the disambiguation policy frowns on disambiguating when it's not necessary, which I believe is the case here. What would be at Pacific Beach if the neighborhood article is moved? Niteowlneils 01:57, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
The state of Washington has a community and a state park named ""Pacific Beach"". I'm sure that general a term will be the name of other notable places as well. Jonathunder 02:13, 2005 Mar 26 (UTC)
Yeah, I thought so too, but even seeking ""Pacific Beach"" -""san diego"" -california -washington -""pacific beach hotel"" -ca -wa still gets only the SD neighborhood and the WA community (which cann be handled with top-of-page-disambiguation. Admittedly, my biggest issue is that I believe the move proposal was for invalid reasons. Niteowlneils 19:02, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Support weakly Either Pacific Beach, San Diego or Pacific Beach, San Diego, California would be fine with me. (Incidentally, Bomis was located in Pacific Beach when Jimmy and Larry started Nupedia.) Ted 17:01, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
It looks like Pacific Beach, San Diego should be the new name. For the moment I won't do it myself – anyone can do it as it currently doesn't exist. violet/riga (t) 21:28, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

In the 1860s, the first Chinese moved to Downtown.[19] In the 1870s, the Chinese were the primary fishermen in the area.[20] Beginning in the 1880s, a large number of Chinese began to move to San Diego, establishing a concentration; with up to 200 Chinese making up a minority of the 8,600 who lived in all of San Diego.[21] At its peak, about a thousand Chinese lived in San Diego and were faced with discrimination.[22] The concentration became known as Chinatown, and an effort to demolish the area due to the Panama-California Exposition was attempted but the area continued on until World War II.[23] Beginning in the early 1900s, Filipinos began to move to San Diego, and settled in and near Chinatown.[24] In 1995, the Asian Pacific Thematic Historic District was created to preserve the remaining structures that remained from the era when Chinatown, as well as Nihonmachi (Japantown), existed.[25] While a few of the buildings remain, there no longer exist a significant concentration of Chinese Americans in the former neighborhood.[26]
The Downtown area contains numerous sites that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include:

The Gaslamp Quarter is a district of San Diego, California. It is a 16½ block historical neighborhood in Downtown San Diego, and is the site of several entertainment and night life venues, as well as scheduled events and festivals, including Mardi Gras in the Gaslamp, Street Scene Music Festival, Taste of Gaslamp and ShamROCK, a St. Patrick's Day event. Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres is located one block away in downtown San Diego's East Village.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslamp_Quarter%2C_San_Diego
Nightlife is a collective term for entertainment that is available and generally more popular from the late evening into the early hours of the morning.[1] It includes pubs, bars, nightclubs, parties, live music, concerts, cabarets, theatre, cinemas, and shows. These venues often require a cover charge for admission. Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime entertainment. People who prefer to be active during the night-time are called night owls.[2]

Cortez Hill, the northeast district of downtown.
East Village, the east district of downtown, which is home to Petco Park and the surrounding Ballpark Village.

Marina, the southwest district of downtown, which is home to Seaport Village and Pantoja Park.
Horton District, the district comprising Horton Plaza and adjacent buildings in central downtown.
Seaport Village, a tourist district within the Marina District, which is not an official district or neighborhood.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_San_Diego
The downtown of San Diego was previously inhabited by the Kumeyaay who referred to the area as Tisirr, and also established a village called Pu-Shuyi near what is now Seaport Village.[3][4]

The city of San Diego was originally focused on Old Town near the Presidio, several miles north of current Downtown. The location was not ideal because it was several miles from navigable water. In 1849 Lt. Andrew B. Gray, a surveyor working with the boundary commission to establish the boundaries of the new state of California, suggested that an area closer to San Diego Bay would be a better location for a city because it would be better for trade. He proposed the idea to William Heath Davis, who recruited four other investors. The partners under Davis's leadership purchased 160 acres (65 ha) of land in what is now Downtown San Diego. They laid out a street plan for New Town and built a wharf and warehouse.[5] Several people built houses there, including the still-standing William Heath Davis House, now a museum.[6] John Judson Ames wrote a prospectus for a newspaper, the San Diego Herald in December 1850, soliciting advertisements and subscriptions from the towns-people;[7] the first issue was published on May 29, 1851.[8] However, New Town did not do well due to a lack of fresh water, a financial depression in 1851, and opposition from the established settlements in Old Town and La Playa.[1] In 1852, a San Diego grand jury called for the removal of several Kumeyaay villages close to any White settlement and the village of Tisirr was razed to the ground.[9]

UCaPrv_BwRFvpIsSnXSmGt0w,40 gaps in .7 miles | Say hello to 'Nosferatu'!,40 gaps in 7 miles Say hello to Nosferatu,OLmCpysHrr0,2022-10-23T23:27:37Z,1318,False,54,16,15:25,"That's right, 40 gaps in .7 miles!  'Nosferatu"" is one of two pro-level trails in an awesome trail system named Empire 47.  

E47 is located about 20 minutes North of Quebec City in Canada and consists of over 35 miles of beautiful trails, primarily on the blue level of difficulty.  'Noferatu' however is a free ride as it get's and completely blew my mind.  The trail is steep, fast, and yes, features over 40 gaps/drop from top to bottom.  Fair warning, this is an expert trail and has no b-lines, so make sure you have the skills before dropping in.  Highly recommend visiting E47 if you are ever riding near Quebec!

Once the mountain bike trails are shut down you basically have two options, hit the slopes or get a fat bike.  Since I am a mountain biker, the fat bike made the most sense, but there are generally two very different opinions of fat bikes out there.  Either fat bikes rule, or fat bikes suck!  It was time to figure it our for myself, so I linked up with Matt from Bootlegger bikes and hit the trails!

Yup! Sugarloaf's enduro MTB scene is back in action with Adam Craig and a massive crew of volunteers at the helm.  The trails are now open to the public, but remain pedal access only.  There are currently 4 enduro trails, which are all listed on Trailforks.  Be advised, both the enduro and DH trails are all brand new trails, built with racing and water management in mind, and are still under construction, so ride with caution.

We spent two days on the mountain digging and riding, and I can honestly say this will be the best ESC venue of the year and some of the best trails that I have personally ridden in the Northeast.  Raw, janky, fast, and steep; you don't want to miss this one!   In addition to the upcoming ESC race, the EWS will be making it's way to the mountain in August of 2022, so expect things to keep getting better between now and then! 

A huge thank you to Sugarloaf Mountain, Brenna Herridge, Adam Craig, the entire ESC family, and all of the riders who showed up to shred and dig.  The community is growing and I am humbled to be able to be a part of it and share with everyone.

A huge thank you to Sugarloaf Mountain, Brenna Herridge, Adam Craig, the entire ESC family, and all of the riders who showed up to shred and dig.  The community is growing and I am humbled to be able to be a part of it and share with everyone.

Beach destinations in Mexico get all the attention, but Mexico City really deserves more love. We picked 4 must see locations for your trip:

1. Museo Nacional de Antropología: If you only see one museum while in Mexico City this one should be it! Full of incredible artifacts it’s pretty hard to see everything in one trip so take your time and don’t rush. Just enjoy what you can see!

2. Avenida Francisco I. Madero: This pedestrian street has lots of shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for a cheap delicious meal try some Tacos de Canasta at Tacos De Canasta Los Especiales. The pozole at La Casa de Toño is also great! Walk all the way to the end of Madero street to see the gorgeous Bellas Artes.

3. Parque Chapultepec: A ginormous park in the center of the city with museums, a lake, a zoo, a castle, and so much more. You could easily spend days here.

4. El Zócalo: The center of the downtown area is home to restaurants, street vendors and sites. The Mexico City cathedral and Templo Mayor are two sites you can’t miss. If you’re looking for a nicer meal with a view check out La Terraza at the Gran Hotel.
