UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA,Mark Wiens,"Food is the reason you should travel, and on my channel you'll watch videos about delicious street food and travel tips!

Hey, I'm Mark Wiens!

After graduating from university, I decided to travel for food. Eventually I ended up in Thailand, where I met my wife. My wife and I are now based in Bangkok, Thailand, but we travel frequently to find delicious food.

You'll find street food videos, travel vlogs, and plenty of Thai food videos as that's where I'm based.

I hope you're ready for a delicious food adventure!

Sundays & Wednesdays at 8 pm Bangkok time (GMT+7), and some occasional extras.

Rick Steves advocates smart, affordable, perspective-broadening travel. As host and writer of the popular public television series ""Rick Steves' Europe,"" and best-selling author of over 50 European travel books, he encourages Americans to travel as ""temporary locals."" He helps American travelers connect much more intimately and authentically with Europe — and Europeans — for a fraction of what mainstream tourists pay.

UCdPambxHRj0kdFPNoJFM98A,George Benson Travel,"George Benson. 

As it suggests on my banner, Football, Travel and Lifestyle is my thing. Right now in 2019, i've decided to really take my workout and fitness routine seriously. I am currently in the process of documenting a Body Transformation seeing me go from being a self proclaimed Skinny Fat Guy, to Lean muscle over a 12 week period. My Body Transformation series is one of the main series currently on my channel, along with Vlogs in London as I am currently based here. Chelsea FC match Vlogs and Chelsea FC Reaction videos, along with Travel Videos and Travel story videos from my time living out of a bag over the past four years. 

I am soon to be on the road again, leaving London in March 2019, to travel the world some more with my girlfriend, Tilda Linderholm! 

Hope you enjoy what you see here. Good vibes all around.

Cheers, George",@georgebenson,2011-12-21 16:19:45+00:00,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu8KL1silSJJz6Hd_g9CGdwJQJpBbCTF4JkCkIrj5w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,,151940500,1030000,1266,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport']",UUdPambxHRj0kdFPNoJFM98A
